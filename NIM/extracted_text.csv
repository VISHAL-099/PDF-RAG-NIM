UNDERSTANDING INDIAN HISTORY
1
Notes
History is the study of past events. It helps us to understand those processes that
enabled the early humans to successfully conquer their environment and develop the
present day civilizations. It is not just a study of battles and kings as is normally
understood by some. It is an analysis of society, economy and cultural trends over a
long period as reflected in  available sources. A historian tries to evaluate different
situations over a long period and asks questions as to why certain events happened
and what was their impact on society at large? Every new evidence or a fresh inter-
pretation of existing evidence by different scholars helps in enriching our knowledge
about the past. A historian differentiates between fact and fiction. However , myths
which are based on oral tradition of a society may contain memories of past happen-
ings. The historian’s job is to ascertain the fact through cross checking of different
historical evidence. In this lesson you will learn how India’s ancient past was con-
structed with the help of large varieties of historical evidence and their interpretation.
OBJECTIVES
After studying this lesson, you will be able to:
 understand historical construction of India’s ancient past;
 know about various types of source material used by ancient historians and
 identify changing traditions of history writing.
1.1 SOURCES FOR RECONSTRUCTING ANCIENT INDIAN HISTORY
A historian needs source material to reconstruct the past. But sources themselves do
not reveal the past. They need interpretation and the historian makes them speak. In
fact the historian is expected to track the source, read texts, follow clues, ask relevant
questions, cross check evidence to offer meaningful explanation. For example in 1826
Charles Masson noticed the high walls and towers of an old settlement in Harappa
Village of western Punjab ( now in Pakistan), and five decides later Sir Alexander
Cunningham collected some seals from the site, but it took archaeologist John Marshall
another fifty years to identify the oldest civilization in the Indus region. We shall offer
another example regarding the historian’s task to cross check (corroborate) different
types of evidence. Nowhere in the sources pertaining to king Harsha (seventh cen-
tury AD) do we find a mention of his defeat at the hands of Chalukya ruler Pulakesin
II. But the inscriptions of Pulakesin II claim a victory over Harsha. In this case it is"

obvious that Harsha’s biographer Bana Bhatt who wrote Harshacharita deliberately
did not mention the defeat of his patron.
The literal meaning of the itihasa is ‘thus it was’ and it is translated as ‘history’. There
was a time when only written records were acknowledged as authentic source of
history. Written material could be verified, cited and cross-checked. Oral evidence i.e
myths and folk songs was never considered a valid source. Earlier historians used
myth, fiction and oral traditions in a limited way on account of their lack of authentic-
ity and verifiability. But today these unconventional sources are being used innovatively.
Traditions and cultural traits should be studied in the light of other historical facts.
For example the Mahabharata is a story of conflict between two sets of warring
cousins. One in not sure whether there was a real war as narrated in the epic. Some
historians believe that the war did happen while others wait for corroborative evi-
dence for the event .The original story was probably composed by bards known as
sutas who generally accompanied Kshatriya warriors to the battlefield and recited
poems in praise of victories and other achievements of their heroes. These composi-
tions were circulated orally and preserved as part of human memory.
LITERARY SOURCES
1.2 RELIGIOUS LITERATURE
Most ancient Indian texts contain religious themes and these are known as Vedas.
They are assigned to c. 1500–500 B.C. The Vedas are four in number. The Rig Veda
mainly consists of prayers. The other three, Sama, Yajur and Atharva-contain prayers,
rituals, magic and mythological stories. The Upanishads contain philosophical discus-
sion on atma and pramatma. They are also referred to as Vedanta.
The two epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata, seem to have been finally compiled by
c.A.D. 400. Of the two, the Mahabharata is attributed to sage Vyasa. It originally
consisted of 8800 verses and was called Jaya gita or a song dealing with victory.
These later got expanded to 24,000 verses and came to be known as Bharata be-
cause it contained the stories of the descendents of one of the earliest Vedic tribes
called Bharata. A further expanded version of 1,00,000 verses was named
Mahabharata. Similarly the Ramayana of Valmiki originally consisted of 6000 verses
than 12,000 verses and was finally expanded to 24,000 verses.
In the post-V edic period ( i.e. after BC600) we have recorded a large number of ritual
literature on moral values called Sutras. Grand public sacrifices to be performed by
rulers are recorded in Shrautasutra while domestic rituals connected with birth, naming,
sacred thread ceremony, marriage, funerals etc. are prescribed in Grihyasutras.
This literature was compiled between c. 600–300 B.C.
The religious books of the Jainas and Buddhists refer to historical persons and incidents
connected with their respective religions. The earliest Buddhist texts were written in Pali.
They are called Tripitakas  (three baskets) viz. Suttapittaka , Vinayapitaka  and
Abhidhammapitaka. Of the most important non religious Buddhist literature are the
Jatakas. They contain the stories of the previous birth of the Buddha. It was believed that
before he was actually born as Gautama, the Buddha passed through over 550 births.
Each birth story is called a Jataka. These stories throw invaluable light on the social and
economic conditions of the period between the fifth and second centuries BC The Jaina
texts were written in Prakrit and were eventually compiled in sixth century AD at Vallabhi
in Gujarat. They are called Angas and contain the philosophical concepts of the Jainas."

1.3 SECULAR LITERATURE
This category of literature does not have religion as its theme. To this class belongs
the Dharmashastras or the law-books which prescribe the duties for different social
groups. They set out punishments for persons guilty of theft , murder, adultery, etc.
The earliest law books is Manu Smriti. It was the first book translated by the British
and formed the basis of Hindu code of law. Arthasastra of Kautilya provides rich
material for the study of Indian economy and polity of the Mauryan period. Works on
grammar are also sometimes useful for historical reconstruction. The earliest and the
most important work on grammar is the Ashtadhyayi written by Panini, which is
dated by scholars to around 700 B.C.
The works of Kalidasa who lived during the Gupta period comprise poems and
dramas. The famous among them are Abhijananashakuntalam, Ritusamhara
and Meghadutam . Besides being great creative compositions, they provide us
with glimpses of the social and cultural life of the Guptas. For the history of
Kashmir we have an important book called Rajataranagini  written by Kalhana(
12th AD) Biographies or charitias are very important non-religious texts for writ-
ing history. They were written by court poets in praise of their patron rulers. As
there is a tendency among them to exaggerate the achievements of the patrons
they have to be studied with caution. One such important text is Harshacharita ,
written by Banabhatta in praise of Harshavardhana.
The earliest south Indian literature is called Sangam literature. It was written in Tamil
and is secular in nature. It was produced by poets who joined together in assemblies
(Sangam) patronized by chiefs and kings during the first four centuries of the Chris-
tian era. The literature consists of short and long poems in praise of various heroes,
written probably to be recited in the courts. It also constitutes the epics called
Silpadikaram and Manimekali. The Sangam literature is our major source for the
study of south Indian society, economy and polity during BC300–AD300. The de-
scriptions given in the Sangam literatures are confirmed by archaeological finds and
accounts of foreign travellers.

1.4 NON-LITERARY SOURCES
INSCRIPTIONS
Inscriptions are permanent writings engraved on hard surface such as stone, metal or
terracotta. Study of inscriptions is called epigraphy. The earliest inscriptions were written
on stone. They usually record the achievements, activities and ideas of those who got
them inscribed. So we get inscriptions which glorify the exploits of kings or mention
donations made by men and women for religious purposes. Those inscriptions which are
composed by poets in praise of kings and patrons are known as prashastis. Some
inscriptions carry dates. Others are dated on the basis of palaeography or style of writing,
with a fair amount of precision. The earliest inscriptions were in Prakrit, a name for a
language used by ordinary people. In later times, Tamil and Sanskrit were also used to
write inscriptions.
The Mauryan king Ashoka was the first person to issue inscriptions. Most of his
inscriptions are in Prakrit language written in the Brahmi script though, some in the
northwest, were written in Kharosthi. The Aramaic and Greek scripts were used for
inscriptions in Afghanistan so that the local people could understand their subject
matter. The Brahmi script was first deciphered in 1837 by James Princep who was a
civil servant during the British rule. Brahmi was written from left to right like Hindi
while Kharosthi from right to left. Ashokan inscriptions help us greatly in understand-
ing his religious and administrative policies. From the first century B.C. the kings
started granting land to religious people. The Satavahans kings of the Deccan were
the first ones to do so. These inscriptions record the concessions granted to the donee
( the receiver of grant ). Such inscriptions help us in finding out the religious and
economic activities of the period. Some of these inscriptions are written on stone but
most on copper plates. The copper plate charters were probably given as a record of
the transaction to those who received the land and were granted concessions.
However, there are some limitations of inscriptional evidence. For example some-
times, letters are very faintly engraved, and thus reconstructions are uncertain. Also,
inscriptions may be damaged or letters missing. Besides, it is not always easy to be
sure about the exact meaning of the words used in inscriptions, some of which may be
specific to a particular place or time.

1.5 COINS
The study of coins is known as numismatics. It not only includes visual elements such as
script and images on the coins but also metallurgical analysis. Ancient coins were mostly
minted in metals such as copper, silver, gold and lead. The earliest coins found in India
contained certain symbols and were called punch-marked coins. They were made of silver
and copper (c. sixth century BC onwards). The first coins to bear the names and images of
rulers were issued by the Indo-Greeks, who established control over the northwestern part
of the subcontinent (c. second century BC). The first gold coins were issued by the Kushanas
in c. first century AD. Some of the most spectacular gold coins were issued by the Gupta
rulers. Their earliest issues are remarkable for their purity of gold content.
Coins provide useful information regarding economic history as they were used as a
medium of exchange. Some coins were issued by guilds or associations of the merchants
and craftsmen with the permission of the rulers. This shows the influence of craft and
commerce. Coins also portray kings and gods, and contain religious symbols, all to which
throw light on the art and religion of the time.
INTEXT QUESTON 1.3
1. What is the study of the coins known as?
2. Name the metals used to make punch-marked coins?
3. Which dynasty issued the first gold coins in India?
1.6 ARCHAEOLOGY
The material remains of the past can be studied with the help of archaeology. Archaeol-
ogy is a science that enables us to systematically dig the successive layers of old mounds
and to form an idea of the material life of the people of the past on the basis of remains
found there. Archaeology is very important to study prehistory i.e. the period before the
invention of writing.  History is basically based on written material. Although writing was
known in India by 2500 BC in the Indus culture, its script has not so far been deciphered.
Thus, though the Harappans knew how to write but the historians have not been able to
read it. Their culture is placed in the period called proto-historic phase. The first script to
be deciphered was Brahmi which was used in the Ashokan inscriptions and it belongs to
the third century BC.
Excavations have brought to light the tools of early humans in India going as back as seven
lakh years.  The excavated sites belonging to the Harappan period show the layout of the
settlements and the form of the houses in which people lived, the type of pottery, tools and
implements they used and the kind of cereals they consumed . In south India some people
were buried along with their tools, weapons, pottery and other belongings under big and
heavy stones. These graves are known as megaliths. By digging them we learn about the
life of people who lived in the Deccan and south India before the third century BC."

The dates of remains found in excavations are fixed by various methods. The most
important of them is the Radiocarbon or Carbon 14 (C14) dating method. Carbon 14
is a radioactive carbon present in all living objects. It decays, like all radioactive sub-
stances, at a uniform rate when the object is dead. By measuring the loss of C14
content in an ancient object (wood or bone) its age can be determined.
The history of climate and vegetation is known through an examination of plant resi-
dues, and especially through pollen analysis. On this basis it is suggested that agricul-
ture was practised in Kashmir and Rajasthan around 7000–6000 BC. The nature and
components of metal artefacts can also be analysed scientifically, and consequently
the mines from which metals were obtained are located and stages in the develop-
ment of metal technology identified. The geological studies provide an idea of the
history of soil, rocks etc, where prehistoric man lived. Human history cannot be un-
derstood without an idea of the continuing interaction between soils, plants and ani-
mal, on one hand, and humans, on the other. Taken together with archaeological
remains, geological and biological studies act as important sources for the recon-
struction and development of human history.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 1.4
1. Define Archaeology?
2. What is the use of C14 dating?
1.7 ACCOUNT OF FOREIGN TRA VELLERS
Indigenous literature can be supplemented by foreign accounts. To India came Greek,
Roman and Chinese visitors, either as ambassadors or travellers or to seek religious
knowledge from time to time. They have left behind an account of the things they
saw. To the court of Chandragupta Maurya came a Greek Ambassador called
Megasthenes who wrote Indika. Its original text is lost but parts of it have been
preserved in fragments quoted by subsequent Greek writers. When read together,
these fragments, furnish valuable information not only about the administration but
also social classes and economic activities of the Mauryan period.
Greek and Roman accounts of the first and second centuries mention many Indian
ports and commodities of trade between India and the Roman Empire. The Periplus
of the Erythrean Sea  and Ptolemy’s Geography, both written in Greek, provide
valuable data in this regard.
Of the Chinese travelers, mention may be made of Fa-hsien and Hsuan Tsang.
Both of them were Buddhist and came to this country mainly to visit the Buddhist
shrines and to study Buddhism. Fa-hsien who came to India in the fifth country AD
describes the conditions in India in the age of Guptas whereas Hsuan Tsang pre-
sents a similar account of India in the seventh century during the time of king
Harshavardhan. Hsuan Tsang also describes in detail the glory of Nalanda Univer-
sity (Bihar) during his times."

1.8 CHANGING NOTIONS OF HISTORY
It was suggested, particularly by western scholars that ancient Indians had no
sense of writing history, But it is not true. Actually, Indian’s sense of writing
history was different from that of the Westerners. The people from the West
recorded events in chronological order while the ancient Indians wrote in a dif-
ferent manner. It can be seen in the texts called the Puranas  where four differ-
ent ages called Krita, Treita, Dvapara and Kali are mentioned. And in each age
we get detailed lists of the rulers and dynasties. Besides, a large number of
inscriptions have been discovered. These give genealogies of kings of various
dynasties and also refer to their achievements. It shows that Indians had the
basic knowledge of time (period) and space where events were taking place.
Modern research in ancient India history began in 1765 when East India Com-
pany took control of Bengal and Bihar. In order to administer the Hindu law,
Manu Smriti the ancient Indian text on law was translated into English in 1776.
These initial efforts of the British to understand ancient laws and customs culmi-
nated in the establishment of Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1784. Under its aegis
and that of several other such societies Hindu religious and classical texts were
translated into English. The greatest impetus to Indological studies was given by
Max Mueller, a German born scholar. Soon the British realized that they needed
an intense knowledge of Indian scriptures and social systems to rule them better.
Even the Christian missionaries felt the need to know more about Indian laws
and customs in order to convert them and help the British strengthen their rule.
While translating the texts, western scholars wrote about Indian unwillingness to
change and they being accustomed to despotic rule.
In 1904, Vincent A Smith wrote Early History of India . It was the first systematic
history of ancient India. In this book his approach to history was pro British and he
tried to justify the British rule in India. It served as good propaganda material for the
perpetuation of despotic British rule.
The Indian scholars, especially those who had received Western education, were
upset about the way the British were presenting India history to their advantage.
uided by the Nationalist ideas some of them took upon themselves the task of rewrit-
ing history to show to the world the true glory of Indian culture. Two notable nation-
alist historians were R.G . Bhandarker (1837–1925) and V .K. Rajwade (1869–1926)
who reconstructed social and political history with the help of various sources. While
doing so they also attacked some of the social evils like child marriage and caste"

system and promoted widow remarriage. The contribution of P.V . Kane (1880–1972)
is remarkable. He wrote a monumental work entitled History of Dharmasastra . It
highlights the chief elements of ancient Indian society.
These Indian scholars carefully studied ancient Indian texts on polity to demon-
strate that ancient Indians had a keen sense of administration. D.R Bhandarkar
(1875–1950), an epigraphist, published books on ancient Indian political institu-
tions. H.C. Raychaudhuri (1892–1957) reconstructed the history of ancient India
and while doing so criticized V .A. Smith at many points. A stronger element
appears in the writings of R.C. Majumdar (1888–1980) who edited a multi-vol-
ume History and Culture of Indian People . Until 1960, Indian scholars inspired
by the idea of nationalism glorified the histories of their respective regions and of
India as such. The merit of exploding the myth of despotism goes to K.P. Jayaswal
(1881–1937). He wrote about the existence of Indian republics and self-govern-
ment in ancient India.
After independence, a new trend in history writing took over. There was a shift to-
wards the writing of non-political history with greater emphasis on society and
economy. The Wonder that was India was one such pioneering work written by A.L.
Basham (1914–1986). A further shift is evident in D.D. Kosambi’s (1907 – 1966)
book An Introduction to the Study of Indian History. His treatment follows a socio-
economic aspect of ancient Indian history. After him a large number of historians
followed the trend and focused on social, economic and cultural history. Their main
stress was on means of production and the social and economic relationship among
different groups of people.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 1.6
1. Describe the trend that developed in history writing after independence.
1.9 THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY
For an overall knowledge of the past, students are to be made aware of various
aspects of society, called THEMES. These themes enable us to learn about de-
velopments in different spheres – social, economic, religious, political and cul-
tural. The developments in these spheres are so much interlinked that they often
break the boundaries between them, for example when the pastoral society of
the early Vedic Age got transformed into settled agricultural society in the later
Vedic Age, the political system changed as a consequence. The king who was
earlier known as Gopati (lord of cattle) in pastoral society became Bhupati (lord
of land) with the development of agricultural economy. And with that the wars
began to be fought for acquiring more land instead of cows. The kings gradually
became powerful and kingship hereditary. So, we notice that changes in different
spheres are related to each other an they often influence major developments. In
this course material you will learn about the development in the fields of art,
architecture, caste system, science and economy, technology and also about the
rise and growth of various religious sects and rituals"

THE GEOGRAPHICAL SETTING AND
PRE-HISTORIC CULTURES OF INDIA
2
Notes
The history of any country or region cannot be understood without some knowledge
of its geography. The history of the people is greatly conditioned by the geography
and environment of the region in which they live. The physical geography and envi-
ronmental conditions of a region include climate, soil types, water resources and
other topographical features. These determine the settlement pattern, population
spread, food products, human behaviour and dietary habits of a region. The Indian
subcontinent is gifted with different regions with their distinct geographical features
which have greatly affected the course of its history.
Geographically speaking the Indian subcontinent in ancient times included the
present day India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Pakistan. On the basis of
geographical diversities the subcontinent can be broadly divided into the follow-
ing main regions. These are:
(i) The Himalayas
(ii) The River Plains of North India
(iii) The Peninsular India

The Himalayas are the world’s largest and the highest mountain ranges. These are
approximately 2,400 kilometers long. (Map 2.1). These ranges have not only checked
invasions but have also protected us from the cold winds coming from north. They
also stop the monsoon winds from the seas which results in rainfall in the northern
plains.  However, there are some mountain passes which, though difficult, have

 The Geographical Setting and pre-historic
provided access to determined invaders, traders, missionaries. These have helped in
developing cultural contacts with Central Asia, China and Tibet in ancient times.
In the north-western direction the broken Himalayan ranges contain the major routes
linking the Indian plains with Iran and Central Asia through Afghanistan. These pass
through the Gomal, Bolan and Khyber passes. The Greeks, Shakas, Kushanas, Hunas
and other foreign tribes reached India following these routes. Likewise, Buddhism
and other Indian elements were carried out to Afghanistan and Central Asia through
these mountain passes.
2.2 THE RIVER PLAINS OF NORTH INDIA
The Himalayas also provide India with three river systems dominated by the Indus,
the Ganges and the Brahmaputra. These rivers made their respective regions fertile
and attracted both settlers and invaders.
The Indus plains include the regions of Punjab and Sind. Irrigated by the tributaries of
the river Indus, they form a vast fertile plain which have made the region the ‘bread-
basket’ of the subcontinent. It is called so because this region is very important for
wheat cultivation. The strategic location and richness of the Punjab region has at-
tracted foreign invaders since ancient past. The Sind region includes the lower Indus
Valley and the delta. It is the Indus plains which witnessed the development of an
urbanized culture called the Harappan culture for the first time in the subcontinent.
(see lesson 3)
The Gangetic basin receives more rainfall and is more humid than the Indus region.
The Gangetic plains is divided into three sub-regions: Upper, Middle and Lower. The
Upper plains of the river Ganges constitute the western and southern parts of Uttar
Pradesh. This region has seen active cultural developments since the ancient period.
This was inhabited by the Aryans in the Later Vedic period, during which they prac-
tised agriculture. The Middle Gangetic plains, which is more fertile and has more
rainfall, include eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. It is the region where mahajanpadas
(territorial states) like Kosala, Kasi and Magadha were established in the 6th century
BC. The two main religions of India, Jainism and Buddhism, also took their birth here.
The lower Gangetic plains constitute the Bengal region. Its northern part is irrigated by
the Brahmputra. The high rainfall in this region created dense forest and marshy land
which made it difficult for the development of settlements in the beginning. But its
coastal areas served as important channels of communication with other regions of the
subcontinent and also with the South-east Asian countries. Tamralipti or Tamluk was an
important seaport of this region which played a significant role in commercial activities.
The Eastern India normally refers to the coastal plains formed by the river Mahanadi
and other streams. The fertile coastal plains of this region helped in the development
of agriculture, society and culture. This came into contact with the Gangetic culture
from the time of the Nandas and the Mauryas (4 th century BC). Around AD 1000
Orissa began to develop her distinct linguistic and cultural identity.
The Western India refers to the regions of the modern states of Rajasthan and Gujarat.
It is known for its black soil which is good for cotton cultivitation. The Thar desert of
Rajasthan, surrounded by the semi-arid regions, was not as fertile as the Gangetic
plains. As a result, this region was not much favourable for cultivation. However, later

wheel (rehat), many settlements emerged here. Rajasthan is also the home of the
Rajput clans. In Gujarat the fertile plains of the rivers Sabarmati, Mahi, Narmada and
Tapti brought prosperity. A very long coastal line too helped Gujarat to develop con-
tacts with other countries through its ports. The most important sea port of this region
has been Brigukaccha or Bharuch (Broach).
2.3 THE PENINSULAR INDIA
Peninsular India includes the Deccan plateau and the coastal plains of South India
(Map 2.2). The plateau is situated to the south of the Vindhya mountains. It is divided
into three major regions which largely correspond to the modern states of Maharashtra,
Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. The northern Deccan plateau comprises of a part of
Maharashtra. A number of Chalcolithic sites inhabited by people using copper and

Deccan. This region with the availability of water and other resources had been more
suitable for human settlements than the northern part. The Raichur doab for its rice
cultivation has been known as the ‘rice-bowl’ of South India. It has been the bone of
contention between different kingdoms. These regions were inhabited right from the
prehistoric times.
The plateau region also has hilly terrains in the Western and Eastern Ghats. The
Western Ghats rise sharply close to the western coast, tapering eastwards into the
plateau. They are cut by a series of passes at Junnar, Kanheri and Karle. These
served as trade routes connecting the ports along the west coast. At the southern end
of the Western Ghats is the Palghat pass which linked the west coast to the Kaveri
valley and played an important role in the Indo-Roman trade in ancient period. The
Eastern Ghats merge more gradually into the plateau and the coastal plain.
The coastal plains constitute the states of Tamil Nadu in east and Kerala on west. In
Tamil Nadu the rivers are seasonal. As a result, the people of this region have de-
pended more on the tank irrigation since the early times. However, Kaveri delta has
been the major region of human attraction. It provided opportunity for the cultivation
of rice and witnessed the flourishing of the Sangam culture in the early historical
period. The ports such as Arikamedu and Kaveripattinam gave impetus to the Indo-
Roman Trade in early centuries of Christian era. The Tamil region evolved a distinct
linguistic and cultural identity of its own.

2.4 INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT
The settlement of people in any region is very much dependent on its environmental
conditions. Environment is taken as the surroundings or conditions in which various
species (men, animals and plants) exist and function. The environment mainly com-
prises of elements such as climate, landscape, rivers, species of plants and animals
(flora and fauna), etc. Now, let us see how environment has influenced the life of
people and their history since ancient past.
A semi-arid region is advantageous to people for settlement purpose. For example,
the Sind region having this type of climate in ancient period, resulted in the flourishing
Harappan civilization. It also helped the growth of urban settlements. Similarly, the
rise of Pataliputra and the importance of Magadha in Bihar can also be explained in
relation to its physical features and environment. Pataliputra was surrounded by the
rivers namely the Ganges, Son and Gandak which provided natural defence as well as
internal communication.  Moreover, the fertile Indo-Gangetic plains helped in the
maintenance of a strong population base.
The environmental conditions also determine the resource potential of a region. The
forested region can be a rich source of timber, whereas the coastal regions yield the
sea products. The hilly regions with rocks containing the mineral ores can lead to the
development of metallurgy. The extraction of metals and their use for tools and other
purposes may add to the standard of living. For example, Magadha was located in
proximity to the iron ore mines and sources of stone and timber in the region of
Chhotanagpur plateau. This strengthened the position of Magadha.
The subsistence pattern is also influenced by the environmental conditions. The re-
gions covered by the river plains have alluvial soil. The fertility of soil helps in surplus
production. The type of soil also determines the crop pattern. For example, black soil
is good for growing cotton. The surplus production results in exchange activities which
develop into trade on a larger scale.
An area gifted with navigable rivers has well developed trade and communication
networks. Our ancient literature like the Jatakas and other texts, mention many riv-
erine routes in ancient India. Similarly, the coastal routes promote the long distance
trade with different countries. The mountain passes are  also very important in this
context. For example, the Palghat pass linked the east and west coasts and thus
helped in the growth of Indo-Roman trade in ancient times.
Thus, we find that the physical features and environment help us to unfold the histori-
cal processes of a region. The diversity of Indian subcontinent presents an uneven
pattern of historical developments. The areas which were rich became important
while those with less resources lagged behind. It is important to observe that the
settlement pattern and mode of life depend on the local resource utilization which in
turn is dependent on the technological developments in that region.

2.5 PREHISTORIC CULTURES
Prehistoric period is that period of our ancient past for which we do not have written
records. Therefore our knowledge of the cultures, which developed in this period, is
based only on the materials found in the archaeological excavations. The earliest man
living during this period made tools and implements of stone found in his surroundings.
These tools helped him to hunt and gather food in order to satisfy his hunger. Since the
earliest tools used by humans were made of stones, this phase of human development
is known as the Stone Age. In this lesson we shall trace the evolution of prehistoric
man from a hunter and food-gatherer to a food producer. This change did not take
place all of a sudden and took several hundred thousand years. On the basis of the
different type of tools and techniques the stages of human development in prehistoric
period are described as the Palaeolithic or Old Stone Age, the Mesolithic or Middle
Stone Age, and the Neolithic or New Stone Age.
2.6  THE PALAEOLITHIC CULTURES
The term Palaeolithic is derived from the Greek word ‘palaeo’, which means old and ‘lithic’
meaning stone. Therefore, the term Palaeolithic age refers to the old stone age. The archae-
ologists have dated this culture to the Pleistocene period about two million years ago. The
Pleistocene period is the geological period of the age when the earth’s surface was covered
with ice, and weather was so cold that human or plant life could not survive. But in the
tropical region, where ice melted, the earliest species of men could exist.
The people lived near the hillocks and used only stone tools for hunting and their protec-
tion. However, the choice of raw material used for tool-making varied from region to
region and depended upon its availability. The material used was quartzite available in
hilly areas of different regions, basalt found in Maharashtra region and limestone in
Karnataka region. On the basis of the nature of progress made in tool types and tech-
niques the Palaeolithic cultures have been divided into three phases. These are – (i)
Lower or Early Palaeolithic, (ii) Middle Palaeolithic, (iii) Upper or Late Palaeolithic.
These phases covered a long period ranging broadly from 5,00,000 to 10,000 B.C.
(a) Tools of the Palaeolithic Period
The main tools of lower Palaeolithic phase were handaxes, cleavers and choppers.
(Fig 2.1) These are called chopping tools. These were rough and heavy and were
made by chipping the sides of the stones. Gradually, sharper and less heavy tools
came to be made.
The flake tools or chipped pieces were the chief tools during the middle Palaeolithic
period. (Fig 2.2) The tools of the upper Palaeolithic period primarily consisted of
burins and scrapers. (Fig 2.3)
Let us now discuss in brief the chief features and uses of some of the tools mentioned
above. In handaxes, the butt end is broader and the working edge is narrow. These"

were used for cutting the trees or digging the roots. The cleavers had a bifaced edge.
These were meant for splitting objects like the trunks of trees. The choppers were the
massive core tools with a unifacial working edge, and were used for chopping pur-
poses. The burins were like flakes or blades. These were used for engraving on soft
stones, bones or rocks. The scrapers were also made of flakes. These tools served
the purpose of obtaining barks of trees and skins of animals.

(b) Geographical Distribution of the Palaeolithic Sites
The geographical distribution of the Palaeolithic sites suggests that this culture was spread
throughout the length and breadth of the Indian subcontinent. (Map 2.3) In the north,
Kashmir Valley and the Sohan Valley in Rawalpindi (now in Pakistan) have yielded
Palaeolithic tools. In Rajasthan, Palaeolithic tools were found at the sites along the
river Luni. In Western India, the Palaeolithic tools were also discovered from the sites of
the rivers Sabarmati, Mahi and their tributaries in Gujarat. In Maharashtra, the most im-
portant sites are Nevasa on a tributary of Godavari and Patne in the Tapti river system. In
Madhya Pradesh, the rock shelters at Bhimbetka (near Bhopal) and Adamgarh in the
district Hoshangabad have yielded tools from the Palaeolithic to the Mesolithic period.
In Uttar Pradesh, the Belan Valley (the region broadly from Allahabad to Varanasi) is
the most prominent site. It shows human occupation of the area continuously from the
Palaeolithic period.

HISTORY
 The Geographical Setting and pre-historic
Towards the east, Assam and neighbouring areas including Meghalaya (Garo Hills)
have yielded prehistoric artifacts. Palaeolithic tools have also been found at various
sites in Bengal, Orissa and Bihar. In Peninsular India, Palaeolithic tools have been
reported from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. In Tamil Nadu, an important site is
Attirampakkam in Chingleput region. The subsistence of the Palaeolithic cultures
was based mainly on hunting animals and gathering fruits and roots. In other words,
the people were primarily hunters and gatherers with no settled habitation.
On the basis of above discussion, we can conclude that the Palaeolithic cultures of
the prehistoric period were wide spread throughout the Indian subcontinent. The study
of the tools indicates a gradual progress in tool technology which must have led to
better availability of resources.
(b) Subsistence Pattern
The Palaeolithic people practised hunting and food-gathering for their subsistence.
They made simple stone tools for hunting, cutting, digging and other purposes.  They
led a nomadic life and migrated to places where plant and animal resources along
with water were easily available.

(a)  (b)  (c) 
2.7 THE MESOLITHIC CULTURES
The term Mesolithic is the combination of two words, meso and lithic. In Greek ‘meso’
means the middle and ‘lithic’ means stone. Hence, the Mesolithic stage of prehistory is
also known as the Middle Stone Age. It was the transitional phase between the Palaeolithic
and the Neolithic Ages. On the basis of archaeological discoveries, the beginning of the
Mesolithic Age in Indian subcontinent is dated to around 10,000 BC.
This period witnessed the rise in temperature, as a result of which the climate became
warm. These changes further resulted in melting of ice of the earlier period and brought
about changes in flora and fauna. Though man was still in hunting-gathering stage, he
now started fishing and some domestication of animals. The main tools they used are
called the microliths or small stone tools. The Rock paintings found at Bhimbetka (near
Bhopal)  belonging to the period indicate the artistic taste of the people.
(a) Tools of the Mesolithic Period
The microliths used during the mesolithic period were very small in size varying in
lengths from 1 to 8 centimeters and were largely made out of chipped or flaked pieces.
(Fig 2.4) Some of these tools have geometric forms such as triangles, lunates and tra-
pezes. There tools could be tied or fixed in other objects to form an arrow or a spear."

The distribution of Mesolithic sites indicates that the Mesolithic cultures covered al-
most the entire India from north to south and east to west. Important sites of this
culture are Langhnaj (District Mehsana) in Gujarat; Bhimbetka (near Bhopal) in
Madhya Pradesh; Chopani Mando (near Allahabad in Belan Valley) in Uttar Pradesh;
Birbhanpur (District Burdwan) in West Bengal; Sanganakallu (District Bellary) in
Karnataka; and Tuticorin in southern Tamil Nadu.
(c) Subsistence Pattern
The Mesolithic people still subsisted on hunting and gathering, but now there was a
shift in the pattern of hunting from the big animals in the Palaeolithic period to the
smaller animals which could be attacked with the help of bows and arrows. In addi-
tion to this, fishing and fowling also became important. The faunal remains of cattle,
sheep, goat, buffalo, pig, rat, bison, hippo, dog, fox, lizard, tortoise and fish etc. have
been found from different Mesolithic sites.

2.8 THE NEOLITHIC CULTURES AND THE ADVENT OF FOOD
PRODUCTION
The last phase of prehistory is termed as Neolithic. The term Neolithic is derived
from Greek ‘neo’ which means new, and ‘lithic’ meaning stone. Thus, the term
‘neolithic Age’ refers to the ‘New Stone Age’ of human culture. In Indian subconti-
nent it is dated back to around 8000 BC. The term ‘Neolithic’ was coined by Jonn
Lubbock. The chief characteristic of this age was the new type of ground and pol-
ished stone tools. This period also marked the beginning of cultivation of plants and
the domestication of animals. It led to the beginning of settled life and the growth of
village settlements. The Neolithic culture had following characteristics:
(i) Beginning of agricultural activities
(ii)Domestication of animals
(iii) Grinding and polishing of stone tools having sharper edges
(iv) Use of pottery
(a) Meaning of the ‘Neolithic Revolution’
Some times this period is termed as the ‘Neolithic Revolution’ on the basis of impor-
tant changes in man’s socio-economic life. The use of the sharp and polished neolithic
tools made it easier to cultivate the soil. It was accompanied by the practice of do-
mestication of animals. These changes in turn resulted in the emergence of settled
agricultural communities. The Neolithic people also produced pottery for the purpose
of storing grains. As the redevelopment in the Neolithic phase greatly affected the
human life, some scholars have used the term “the Neolithic Revolution” to signify
those changes. But most of the scholars believe that these changes though significant,
should be viewed in the context of earlier progress during Paleolithic and Mesolithic
ages, and thus, should be considered as ‘evolution’ rather than ‘revolution’.
(b) Tools of the Neolithic Period
The Neolithic tools consist of the ground tools having smooth surfaces, and well-
rounded and symmetrical shapes. The grinding made the tools sharper, polished and
more effective than those in the earlier period. (Fig. 2.5) The ground stone tools of the
Neolithic period included different types of axes called ‘celt’. Besides the stone tools,
the sites of this period have also yielded various types of bone objects such as needles,
scrapers, borers, arrowheads, pendants, bangles and earrings. (Fig 2.6)"

Burzahom and Gufkral. The dwelling pits, either circular or rectangular, at these sites
form an important feature of Neolithic culture. The Belan Valley along the edge of
Vindhyan plateau near Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh also has many Neolithic sites such
as Koldihwa and Mahagara. The Neolithic tools (both stone and bone), pottery, other
artefacts, floral and faunal remains have been found from these sites. In Bihar and
mid-Gangetic Valley region Chirand is the most popular Neolithic site. Several Neolithic
sites are present covering the hills of Assam, Meghalaya and Nagaland. The tools like
Neolithic celts, small ground axes alongwith the remains of pottery have been found
from this area. In South India the Neolithic settlements were discovered along the
rivers Bhima, Krishna, Tungabhadra and Kaveri. Some important sites are
Sanganakallu, Brahmagiri, Maski, Piklihal, Hallur in Karnataka; Utnur, Nagarjunakonda,
Budihal in Andhra Pradesh; and Paiyampalli in Tamil Nadu. These sites have yielded
dwelling pits alongwith the evidence of cultivation of cereals and domestication of

South India.
(d) Subsistence Pattern
The advent of agriculture marked a significant change in Neolithic phase. The
people cultivated various kinds of crops such as wheat, barley, rice, millet, lentils,
etc,. depending on the geographical conditions. Agriculture gave impetus to ani-
mal domestication. Hunting still remained an important occupation. The people
domesticated animals which included sheep, goat, cattle, etc. and also hunted
wild animals such as boar, nilgai, gazells, etc. Different kinds of stone tools were
made by Neolithic people, which has already been discussed. The Neolithic people
also manufactured pottery, which was initially hand made and later turned on
wheel and fired in large kilns. These were the major means of storage for grains.
In nutshell, we can say that the Neolithic cultures were characterised by change
from hunting and gathering to cultivation of plants and domestication of animals.
The new polished tools made it easier for humans to cultivate, hunt and perform
other activities in a better manner. It led to greater availability of food resources
as well as to an increase in population, which in turn resulted in the increase in the
number of village settlements. The Neolithic cultures created the conditions which
helped in the growth of towns in the later period.

ceremony are also shown in the rock paintings. The scenes of hunting in a group

leading to the emergence of powerful states in the 6 th century BC. The Plateau re-
gion, the Coastal Plains and the hilly terrains of Peninsular India have encouraged the
agricultural settlements and foreign contacts since ancient times. Different environ-

economic and cultural formations in different regions.
Since his appearance in Prehistoric period, the humans have passed through many
stages of cultural growth. Archaeological sources show his existence and subsistence
pattern at various sites in different parts of the subcontinent. He was a hunter-gath-
erer in the Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods. By the Neolithic period he learnt culti-
vation of crops and domestication of animals. He could also manufacture pottery by
then. These developments led to the establishment of village settlements. The stone
tools used in different periods also underwent change. The crude and blunt tools of
the Palaeolithic period were developed into sharper and polished ones in the Neolithic
period. The Mesolithic period was characterized by very small stone tools called the
microliths. In other words, the hunter-gatherer of the Paleolithic period evolved into
the food producer of the Neolithic period.

 THE HARAPPAN CIVILIZATION
3
Notes
In the previous chapter you learnt that the people in the prehistoric times used tools
and weapons made of stone. Later man started using metals. Copper was the first
metal to be used by man for making tools. Gradually several cultures developed in
Indian subcontinent which were based on the use of stone and copper tools. They
also used bronze, a mixture of copper and tin, for this purpose. This phase in history is
known as the Chalcolithic chalco-Copper; lithic-Stone) period. The brightest chap-
ter in the Chalcolithic period in India is the Harappan civilization which is also referred
to as the Indus Valley civilization.
Harappan civilization was discovered in 1920–22 when two of its most important
sites were excavated. These were Harappa on the banks of the river Ravi and
Mohenjodaro on the banks of the Indus. The first was excavated by D. R. Sahani
and the second by R.D. Bannerji. On the basis of the archaeological findings the
Harappan civilization has been dated between 2600 B.C–1900 BC and is one of the
oldest civilizations of the world. It is also sometimes referred to as the ‘Indus Valley
civilization’ because in the beginning majority of its settlements discovered were in
and around the plains of the river Indus and its tributaries. But today it is termed as
the Harappan civilization because Harappa was the first site, which brought to light
the presence of this civilization. Besides, recent archaeological findings indicate that
this civilization was spread much beyond the Indus Valley. Therefore, it is better it is
called as the Harappan civilization. It is the first urban culture of India and is contempora-
neous with other ancient civilizations of the world such as those of Mesopotamia and
Egypt. Our knowledge of the life and culture of the Harappan people is based only on the
archaeological excavations as the script of that period has not been deciphered so far.
The Harappan civilization did not appear all of a sudden. It developed gradually from earlier
Neolithic village cultures. It is believed that the better technology to exploit the fertile plains of
river Indus might have resulted in increased agricultural production. This led to the production
of larger surplus to feed and maintain non-agricultural people such as artisans, administrators,
etc. It also helped in the promotion of exchange or trading contacts with distant regions. It
brought prosperity to the Harappan people and they were able to set up cities.
By around 2000 BC several regional cultures developed in different parts of the subcon-
tinent which were also based on the use of stone and copper tools. These Chalcolithic
cultures which lay outside the Harappan zone were not so rich and flourishing. These
were basically rural in nature. The origin and development of these cultures is placed in
the chronological span between circa 2000 BC–700 BC. These are found in Western
and Central India and are described as non-Harappan Chalcolithic cultures."

  The Harappan Civilization
OBJECTIVES
After studying this lesson, you will be able to:
 explain the origin and extent of the Harappan civilization;
 describe the Harappan town-planning;
 understand the Harappan social and economic life;
 discuss the Harappan religious beliefs;
 explain how and why did the civilization decline;
 identify the Chalcolithic Communities outside Harappan zone;
 explain economic condition and settlement pattern of these Chalcolithic commu-
nities.
3.1 ORIGIN AND EXTENT
The archaeological remains show that before the emergence of Harappan civiliza-
tion the people lived in small villages. As the time passed, there was the emergence
of small towns which ultimately led to full-fledged towns during the Harappan period.
The whole period of Harappan civilization is in fact divided into three phases: (i)
Early Harappan phase (3500 BC–2600 BC) – it was marked by some town-planning
in the form of mud structures, elementary trade, arts and crafts, etc., (ii) Mature
Harappan phase (2600 BC–1900 BC) – it was the period in which we notice well-
developed towns with burnt brick structures, inland and foreign trade, crafts of vari-
ous types, etc., and (iii) Late Harappan phase (1900 BC–1400 BC) – it was the
phase of decline during which many cities were abandoned and the trade disap-
peared leading to the gradual decay of the significant urban traits.
Let us first have a glance over the geographical extent of the Harappan civilization.
The archaeological excavations reveal that this culture was spread over a vast area
which included not only the present day states of India such as Rajasthan, Punjab,
Haryana, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Western Uttar Pradesh but also Pakistan and some
parts of Afghanistan. Some important sites of this civilization are: Manda in Jammu and
Kashmir; Shortughai in Afghanistan; Harappa in Western Punjab (Pakistan); Mohenjodaro
and Chanhudaro in Sind; Kalibangan in Rajasthan; Lothal and Dholavira in Gujarat;
Banawali and Rakhigarhi in Haryana; Daimabad in Maharashtra while Sutkagendor on
the Makran Coast (near Pakistan-Iran border) is the western most site of the Harappan
civilization and Alamgirpur in western Uttar Pradesh marks its eastern most limit.
The location of settlements suggests that the Harappa, Kalibangan (On R Ghaggar-
Hakra generally associated with the lost river Saraswati), Mohenjodaro axis was the
heartland of this civilization and most of the settlements are located in this region.
This area had certain uniform features in terms of the soil type, climate and subsis-
tence pattern. The land was flat and depended on the monsoons and the Himalayan
rivers for the supply of water. Due to its distinct geographical feature, agro-pastoral
economy was the dominant feature in this region.
Besides the urban settlements of the Harappans, there were many sites inhabited by
the primitive communities consisting of stone-age hunter-gatherers or pastoral"

nomads, which existed side by side. Some sites served as ports or trading out-posts. It
may be noted that the important determinants of urbanisation are well-planned cities,
specialised arts and crafts, trade, taxation, script, etc. In this respect Harappan cul-
ture fulfilled all these criteria for being called as an urban culture.

6. What are the important features of an urban culture?
3.2 TOWN PLANNING
The most interesting urban feature of Harappan civilization is its town-planning. It is
marked by considerable uniformity, though one can notice some regional variations as
well. The uniformity is noticed in the lay-out of the towns, streets, structures, brick size,
drains etc. Almost all the major sites (Harappa, Mohenjodaro, Kalibangan and oth-
ers), are divided into two parts–a citadel on higher mound on the western side and
a lower town on the eastern side of the settlement. The citadel contain large struc-
tures which might have functioned as administrative or ritual centres. The residen-
tial buildings are built in the lower town. The streets intersect each other at right
angles in a criss-cross pattern. It divides the city in several residential blocks. The
main street is connected by narrow lanes. The doors of the houses opened in these
lanes and not the m ain streets.
The houses of common people, however, differed in size from a single-room house in
Harappa to bigger structures. The houses were largely built of burnt bricks. The
bigger houses had many rooms surrounding a square courtyard. These houses
were provided with private wells, kitchens and bathing plateforms. The differ-
ence in the size of the houses suggests that the rich lived in the larger houses
whereas the one-room buildings or barracks might have been intended for the
poorer section of the society.
The drainage system of the Harappans was elaborate and well laidout. Every house
had drains, which opened into the street drains. These drains were covered with
manholes bricks or stone slabs (which could be removed for cleaning) were con-
structed at regular intervals by the side of the streets for cleaning. This shows that the
people were well acquainted with the science of sanitation.

3.3  SOME MAJOR STRUCTURAL REMAINS OF THE HARAPPAN TOWNS
At Mohenjodaro the ‘Great Bath’ is the most important structure. (Fig 3.1) It is sur-
rounded by corridors on all sides and is approached at either end a by a flights of steps in
north and south. A thin layer of bitumen was applied to the bed of the Bath to ensure that
water did not seep in. Water was supplied by a large well in an adjacent room. There was
a drain for the outlet of the water. The bath was surrounded by sets of rooms on sides for"

changing cloth. Scholars believe that the ‘Great Bath’ was used for ritual bathing. An-
other structure here located to the west of the ‘Great Bath’ is the granary. It consists of
several rectangular blocks of brick for storing grains. A granary has also been found at
Harappa. It has the rows of circular brick platforms, which were used for threshing
grains. This is known from the finding of chaffs of wheat and barley from here.
At Lothal, a brick structure has been identified as a dockyard meant for berthing ships
and handling cargo. (Fig 3.2) This suggests that Lothal was an important port and
trading centre of the Harappan people.

1. The citadel in Harappan towns was normally located in which direction.
2. What kind of bricks were used for building the houses?
3. Where was the ‘Great Bath’ discovered?
4. Name the major structure found at Lothal.
3.4 ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES
(i) Agriculture
The prosperity of the Harappan civilization was based on its flourishing economic activi-
ties such as agriculture, arts and crafts, and trade. The availability of fertile Indus alluvium
contributed to the surplus in agricultural production. It helped the Harappan people to indulge
in exchange, both internal and external, with others and also develop crafts and industries.
Agriculture alongwith pastoralism (cattle-rearing) was the base of Harappan economy.
The granaries discovered at sites like Harappa, Mohenjodaro and Lothal served as

the storehouses for grains. We do not have any clear evidence of the tools used for
agriculture. However, the furrows or plough-marks have been observed in a field at
Kalibangan. These indicate plough cultivation. A terracotta plough has also been re-
ported from Banawali in Hissar district of Haryana. The irrigation was carried on a
small scale by drawing water from wells or by diverting river water into channels.
The chief food crops included wheat, barley, sesasum, mustard, peas, jejube, etc. The
evidence for rice has come from Lothal and Rangpur in the form of husks embedded in pottery.
Cotton was another important crop. A piece of woven cloth has been found at Mohenjodaro.
Apart from cereals, fish and animal meat also formed a part of the Harappan diet.
(ii) Industries and Crafts
The Harappan people were aware of almost all the metals except iron. They manu-
factured gold and silver objects. The gold objects include beads, armlets, needles and
other ornaments. But the use of silver was more common than gold. A large number
of silver ornaments, dishes, etc. have been discovered. A number of copper tools and
weapons have also been discovered. The common tools included axe, saws, chisels,
knives, spearheads and arrowheads. It is important to note that the weapons pro-
duced by the Harappans were mostly defensive in nature as there is no evidence of
weapons like swords, etc. Stone tools were also commonly used. Copper was brought
mainly from Khetri in Rajasthan. Gold might have been obtained from the Himalayan
river-beds and South India, and silver from Mesopotamia. We also have the evidence
of the use of the bronze though in limited manner. The most famous specimen in this
regard is the bronze ‘dancing girl’ figurine discovered at Mohenjodaro. (Fig 3.3) It is
a nude female figure, with right arm on the hip and left arm hanging in a dancing pose.
She is wearing a large number of bangles.
Bead-making also was an important craft. Beads were made of precious and semi-
precious stones such as agate and carnelian. Steatite was used for making beads.
The evidence of beadmakers’ shops have been found at Chanhudaro and Lothal.
Gold and silver beads have also been found. Ivory carving and inlaying used in beads,
bracelets and other decorations were also in practice. The Harappans thus showed
their masterly skill in a variety of arts and crafts.

A well-known piece of art of the Harappan period is a stone sculpture of a bearded
man discovered at Mohenjodaro. (Fig 3.4) His eyes are half closed indicating a pos-
ture of meditation. Across the left shoulder is an embroidered cloak. In the opinion of
some scholars it could be a bust of a priest.
A large number of terracotta figurines of males and females have been discovered from
various Harappan sites. (Fig 3.5) The female figurines outnumber those of males and
are believed to represent the worship of mother goddess. Besides these, a variety of
models of birds, monkeys, dogs, sheep, cattle, humped and humpless bulls are found.
However, the noteworthy specimen in this regard are various models of terracotta carts.
Pottery-making was also an important industry in the Harappan period. These were
chiefly wheel-made and were treated with a red coating and had decorations in black.
These are found in various sizes and shapes. The painted designs consist of horizontal
lines of varied thickness, leaf patterns, palm and pipal trees. Birds, fishes and animals
are also depicted on potteries.
The Harappans manufactured seals of various kinds. More than two thousand seals
have been discovered from different sites. These were generally square in shape and
were made of steatite. It is noteworthy that while the seals depict a number of ani-

mals there is no representation of horse on these. It has led many scholars to argue
that horse was not known to the Harappan people though there are others who do not
accept this argument. Besides various kinds of animals, the Harappan seals contain
some signs in the Harappan script which however has not been deciphered so far.
The most famous of the seals is the one with a horned male deity represented on it.
He has three heads and is sitting in a yogic posture surrounded by four animals viz
elephant, tiger, rhinoceros and a buffalo. He has been identified by many scholars
with the ancient form of the god Pashupati (Lord of beasts) though there are others
who dispute this identification.

(iii) Trade
Trading network, both internal (within the country) and external (foreign), was a
significant feature of the urban economy of the Harappans. As the urban population
had to depend on the surrounding countryside for the supply of food and many other
necessary products, there emerged a village-town (rural-urban) interrelationship. Simi-
larly, the urban craftsmen needed markets to sell their goods in other areas. It led to
the contact between the towns. The traders also established contacts with foreign
lands particularly Mesopotamia where these goods were in demand.
It is important to note that various kinds of metals and precious stones were needed by
craftsmen to make goods, but as these were not available locally they had to be brought
from outside. The presence of such raw material found at sites away from the place of
its origin naturally indicates it must have reached there through an exchange activity.
Thus Rajasthan region is rich in copper deposits and the Harappans acquired copper
mainly from the Khetri mines located here. Kolar gold fields of Karnataka and the
river-beds of the Himalayan rivers might have supplied the gold. The source of silver
may have been Jwar mines of Rajasthan. It is believed that it must have also come from
Mesopotamia in exchange for the Harappan goods.
Among the precious stones used for making beads, the source of lapis-lazuli was located
in Badakshan mines in northeast Afghanistan. Turquoise and Jade might have been brought
from Central Asia. Western India supplied agate, chalcedony and carnelian. The seashells
must have come from Gujarat and neighbouring coastal areas. Timber of good quality and
other forest products were perhaps obtained from the northern regions such as Jammu.
The Harappans were engaged in external trade with Mesopotamia. It was largely
through Oman and Behrain in the Persian Gulf. It is confirmed by the presence of
Harappan artefacts such as beads, seals, dice etc. in these regions. Though the artefacts
from those regions are rarely found at the Harappan sites, a seal of West Asian or
Persian origin has been discovered at Lothal which confirms this contact.
Mesopotamian cities like Susa, Ur, etc. have yielded about two dozen of Harappan
seals. Besides seals, other artefacts of Harappan origin which have been discovered
include potteries, etched carnelian beads and dices with Harappan features.
The inscriptional evidence from Mesopotamia also provides us with valuable infor-
mation on Harappan contact with Mesopotamia. These inscriptions refer to trade
with Dilmun, Magan and Meluhha. Scholars have identified Meluhha with Harappan
region, Magan with the Makran coast, and Dilmun with Bahrain. They indicate that
Mesopotamia imported copper, carnelian, ivory, shell, lapis-lazuli, pearls and ebony
from Meluhha. The export from Mesopotamia to Harappans included items such as
garments, wool, perfumes, leather products and sliver. Except silver all these prod-
ucts are perishable. This may be one important reason why we do not find the re-
mains of these goods at Harappan sites.

3.5 SOCIAL DIFFERENTIATION
The Harappan society appears to have been matriarchal in nature. This view is based
on the popularity of the mother goddess as indicated by the finding of a large number of
terracotta female figurines in Punjab and Sind region. As Harappan script has not been
deciphered till now, we have to satisfy ourselves with this limited information on this issue.
The Harappan Society comprised of people following diverse professions. These in-
cluded the priests, the warriors, peasants, traders and artisans (masons, weavers, gold-
smith, potters, etc.) The structural remains at sites such as Harappa and Lothal show
that different types of buildings that were used as residence by different classes. The
presence of a class of workmen is proved by workmen quarters near the granary at
Harappa. Similarly, the workshops and houses meant for coppersmiths and beadmakers
have been discovered at Lothal. Infact, we can say that those who lived in larger
houses belonged to the rich class whereas those living in the barracks like workmen
quarters were from the class of labourers.
Our limited knowledge about their dress styles comes from the terracotta figurines and
stone sculptures of the period. Men are mostly shown wearing a dress wrapped round the
lower half of the body with one end worn over the left shoulder and under the right arm.
The other garment was a skirt like dress to cover the lower portion. They used cotton and
woollen clothes. A piece of woven cloth has been found at Mohenjodaro. Spindles and
needles discovered at many sites attest to the practice of spinning and weaving.
Harappan people loved to decorate themselves. Hair dressing by both, men and women,
is evident from figurines found at different sites. The men as well as women arranged
their hair in different styles. The people were also fond of ornaments. These mainly
included necklaces, armlets, earrings, beads, bangles, etc., used by both the sexes.
Rich people appear to have used the ornaments of gold, silver and semi-precious
stones while the poor satisfied themselves with those of terracotta.

3.6 RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND PRACTICES
Our knowledge on the religious beliefs and practices of the Harappans is largely based
on the Harappan seals and terracotta figurines available to us. The Harappan religion is
normally termed as animism i.e., worship of trees, stones etc. (Fig 3.8) A large number
of terracotta figurines discovered at the Harappan sites have been associated with the
worship of mother goddess. (Fig 3.9) Many of these represent females adorned with a
wide girdle, loin cloth and necklaces. They wear a fan-shaped head dress. In some
cases the female is shown with an infant while there is one that shows a plant growing
out of the uterus of a woman. The latter type probably symbolizes the goddess of earth.
There are many scholars who refer to the worshiping of linga (phallus) and yoni (fe-
male sex organ) by the Harappans but some are doubtful about it.
Harappans’ belief in a male deity is evident by the seal depicting a deity with a buffalo-
horned head-dress, sitting in a yogic posture and surrounded by animals. Many scholars
identify him with god Pashupati (Lord of beasts) or ‘Proto-Shiva’ though some dispute it.
In another instance, a deity is shown with horns and flowing hair standing nude between
the branches of a Pipal tree and a worshipper is kneeling in front. It may represent tree
worship.  Animal worship also appears to be popular among the Harappans.
The evidence of fire worship has also been found at some sites such as Kalibangan and
Lothal. At Kalibangan, a series of raised brick platforms with pits containing ash and
animal bones have been discovered. These are identified by many scholars as fire altars.
Fig 3.9 Mother Goddess from Mohenjodero
Fig 3.8 Symbolic Pipal Tree from Mohenjodero
This also shows that the Harappans living in
different areas followed different religious prac-
tices as there is no evidence of fire-pits at
Harappa or Mohanjodaro.
The burial practices and the rituals related
with them have been a very important as-
pect of religion in any culture. However, in
this context Harappan sites have not yielded
any monument such as the Pyramids of
Egypt or the Royal cemetry at Ur in
Mesopotamia. Dead bodies were generally
rested in north-south direction with their head"

towards north and the feet towards south. The dead were buried with a varying
number of earthen pots. In some graves the dead were buried along with goods such
as bangles, beads, copper mirrors. This may indicate that the Harappans believed in
life after death. At Lothal three joint or double burials with male and female bodies
together were discovered. Kalibangan has yielded evidence of a symbolic burial along

i.e., a burial which contains pots but no bones or skeleton. These different practices in
different regions of Harappan civilization may reflect diversity in religious beliefs.

2. Which tree is often represented on the Harappan seals?

4.  At which place have joint burials been found?
3.9 THE SCRIPT
The Harappans were literate people. Harappan seals, are engraved with various signs
or characters. Recent studies suggest that the Harappan script consists of about 400
signs and that it was written from right to left. However, the script has not been
deciphered as yet. It is believed that they used ideograms i.e., a graphic symbol or
character to convey the idea directly. We do not know the language they spoke,
though scholars believe that they spoke “Brahui”, a dialect used by Baluchi people in
Pakistan today. However further research alone can unveil the mystery and enable
us to know more about the Harappan script.
3.10 DECLINE OF THE HARAPPAN CIVILIZATION
The Harappan Civilization flourished till 1900 BC. The period following this is marked by
the beginning of the post-urban phase or (Late Harappan phase). This phase was"

  The Harappan Civilization
characterised by a gradual disappearance of the major traits such as town-planning, art of
writing, uniformity in weights and measures, homogeneity in pottery designs, etc. The
regression covered a period from 1900 BC–1400 BC There was also the shrinkage in the
settlement area. For instance, Mohenjodaro was reduced to a small settlement of three
hectares from the original eighty five hectares towards the end of the Late phase. The
population appears to have shifted to other areas. It is indicated by the large number of
new settlements in the outlying areas of Gujarat, east Punjab, Haryana and Upper Doab
during the later Harappan period.
You may be wondering how the Harappan Civilization came to an end. Well scholars
put forward many theories in this regard.
(i) It is suggested by some scholars that natural calamities such as floods and earth-
quakes might have caused the decline of the civilization. It is believed that earth-
quakes might have raised the level of the flood plains of the lower course of
Indus river. It blocked the passage of the river water to the sea and resulted in
the floods which might have swallowed the city of Mohenjodaro. However, this
only explains the decline of Mohenjodaro and not of the whole civilization.
(ii) Increased aridity and drying up of the river Ghaggar-Harka on account of the
changes in river courses, according to some scholars, might have contributed to the
decline. This theory states that there was an increase in arid conditions by around
2000 BC. This might have affected agricultural production, and led to the decline.
(iii) Aryan invasion theory is also put forward as a cause for the decline. According
to this, the Harappan civilization was destroyed by the Aryans who came to India
from north-west around 1500 BC. However, on the basis of closer and critical
analysis of data, this view is completely negated today.
Thus, there is no single cause that can explain the decline of the civilization in totality. At
the maximum these can explain the decay of certain sites or areas only. Hence, each
theory has met with criticism. Nevertheless, the archaeological evidence indicates that
the Harappan civilization did not collapse all of a sudden but declined gradually and ulti-
mately merged with other local cultures.

evidence of the chalcolithic cultures also comes from eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar
and Bengal. (Map 3.2) It may be noted that the non-Harappan Chalcolithic cultures
though flourished in different regions they were marked by basic uniformity in vari-
ous aspects such as their mud structures, farming and hunting activities, use of wheel
made pottery etc. The pottery of these chalcolithic cultures included ochre coloured
pottery (OCP), black-and-red ware (BRW) and has been found in the shape of vari-
ous kinds of bowls, basins, spouted jars with concave necks, dishes on stand, etc.

3.12 TOOLS, IMPLEMENTS AND OTHER OBJECTS
The chalcolithic cultures are characterised by the use of tools made of copper as well
as stone. They used chalcedony, chert etc. for making stone tools. The major tools
used were long parallel-sided blades, pen knives, lunates, triangles, and trapezes. Some
of the blade tools were used in agriculture. Main copper objects used include flat axes,
arrowheads, spearheads, chisels, fishhooks, swords, blades, bangles, rings and beads. Beads
made of carnelian, jasper, chalcedony, agate, shell, etc. frequently occur in excavations. In this
context, the findings from Daimabad hoard are noteworthy. The discovery includes bronze
rhinoceros, elephant, two-wheeled charriot with a rider and a buffalo. These are massive and
weigh over sixty kilograms. From Kayatha (Chambal valley) also copper objects with sharp
cutting edges have been recovered. These reflect the skills of the craftsmen of the period.
3.13 SUBSISTENCE ECONOMY
The people of these settlements subsisted on agriculture and cattle rearing. However,
they also practised hunting and fishing. The main crops of the period include, rice,
barley, lentils, wheat, jawar, coarse gram, pea, green gram, etc. It is to be noted that the major
parts of this culture flourished in the zone of black soil, useful mainly for growing cotton.
Skeletal remains from the sites suggest the presence of domesticated and wild ani-
mals in these cultures. The important domesticated animals were cattle, sheep, goat,
dog, pig, horse, etc. The wild animals included black buck, antelope, nilgai, barasinga,
sambar, cheetah, wild buffalo and one-horn rhino. The bones of fish, water fowl,
turtle and rodents were also discovered.
3.14 HOUSES AND HABITATIONS
The Chalcolithic cultures were characterised by rural settlements. The people lived in
rectangular and circular houses with mud walls and thatched roofs. Most of the houses
were single roomed but some had two or three rooms. The floors were made of burnt
clay or clay mixed with river gravels. More than 200 sites of Jorwe culture
(Maharashtra) have been found. The settlements at Inamgaon (Jorwe culture) sug-
gests that some kind of planning was adopted in laying of the settlement.

  The Harappan Civilization
WHAT YOU HA VE LEARNT
The Harappan civilization was the first urban civilization of the Indian subcontinent.
Archaeological discoveries show that this culture evolved from the earlier rural com-
munities. Harappa, Mohenjodaro, Chanhudaro, Kalibangan, Lothal, Banawali,
Rakhigarhi and Dholavira were some of the important sites of the Harappan civiliza-
tion. Well-planned towns can be observed at some Harappan centres. These towns
were characterised by two broad divisions–a citadel on a higher mound and the lower
town. Burnt bricks were used for building houses. The towns had good drainage
system. Some major buildings at the Harappan towns were the Great Bath at
Mohenjodaro, a granary at Harappa, and a dockyard at Lothal. The Harappans prac-
tised agriculture alongwith pastoralism. Though there were skilled craftsmen who worked
in copper and other metals, the stone tools were still in common use. They produced
beads, terracotta figurines, potteries and seals of various kinds. The Harappans carried
out trade, both internal and external. They had commercial links with Mesopotamian
cities through Oman and Bahrain in the Persian Gulf. The merchants traded in various
commodities of import and export. The Harappan society seems to have been matriar-
chal in nature. The people followed different professions such as those of priests, phy-
sicians, warriors, peasants, traders and artisans. Though the Harappans wore simple
clothes made of cotton and wool, they were fond of decorating themselves with various
kinds of ornaments. The Harappans worshipped the mother goddess, Pashupati (Proto-
Shiva), trees and animals. They also followed different kinds of burial practices and
rituals associated with them. The Harappans were literate and their script is in the form
of ideograms. However, the script has not been deciphered so far. Once it is deciphered,
we will be able to know more about the Harappan culture. Scholars have suggested
various factors such as natural calamities, increased aridity, and the Aryan invasion for
the decline of the culture. The archaeological evidence suggests that this civilization did
not face a sudden collapse but had a gradual decline.
The archaeological sources reflect that the non-Harappan Chalcolithic cultures were
characterized by regional variations. The use of stone and copper (Chalcolithic) tools
was the distinct feature of these cultures. The distribution pattern of the sites suggests
hierarchy of settlements. Some settlements were large in size with elaborate structures,
indicating that these were important centres. The Chalcolithic cultures outside the orbit
of the Harappan culture did not possess Harappan traits of urbanity and prosperity.
These were non-urban cultures with certain elements of their own such as the housing
pattern, pottery types, tool types, religious practices, etc. They still subsisted on agricul-
ture and hunting-gathering economy combined with pastoralism.

Notes
In the previous lesson, you read about the Harappan Civilization. The Harappans lived
in cities and had a well organized trade and craft activities. They also had a script which
we have been so far not able to decipher. However around 1900 BC these cities began
to decline. A number of rural settlements appeared afterwards. These rural settlements
show continuity of certain Harappan elements. Around the same time we find archaeo-
logical evidence of the arrival of new people known as Aryans or Indo-Aryans on the
outskirts of the Harappan region. In the present lesson, we shall study the circum-
stances under which these new people arrived and also learn about the main features
of their culture as depicted in the literature called the Vedas.
OBJECTIVES
After studying this lesson, you will be able to:
 learn about the Vedic texts and the nature of their contents;
 know about the Aryans and identify the region from where they migrated;
 locate the regions inhabited by the Early Vedic (1500BC–1000BC) and the Later
Vedic people (1000BC–600BC);
 explain the importance and impact of the use of iron implements which began in
Later Vedic period, and
 identify the changes which appeared in the economic, social, religious and politi-
cal structures and institutions of the Vedic people over a period extending from
1000 BC to 600 BC.
 4.1 THE VEDIC TEXTS
What is veda? The word veda is derived from the root vid which means ‘to know’. The
word veda means the sacred knowledge contained in the texts known as Vedic text. Two
categories of texts are included in the corpus of the Vedic literature. These are Mantra
and Brahmana. The Mantra category forms the core of the Vedic texts and has four
separate collections. These are the Rigveda, the Samaveda, the Yajurveda, and the
Atharvaveda. The Brahmanas not to be confused with Brahaminical class are prose
texts containing the explanations of the mantras as well as the sacrificial rituals. The four
Vedas together with their Brahmanas are also known as shruti or ‘hearing’, that which
was directly heard by the sages. The Aranyakas (literally forest treatises) and the
Upanishads (sitting down beside) are mainly appendices to the Brahmanas. These are
also known as the Vedanta (end of the Veda) and contain philosophical discussions."

HISTORY
 The Vedic Age (1500BC–600BC)
The Rigveda is a collection of 1,028 hymns divided into 10 mandalas. They are the
earliest compositions and hence depict the life of the early Vedic people in India. The
Samaveda is a collection of verses mostly taken from the Rigveda but arranged in a
poetic form to facilitate singing. The Yajurveda is found in two recensions, Black and
White, and are full of rituals to be performed publicly or individually. The Atharvaveda
is a collection of magic spells and charms to ward off the evil spirits and diseases.
Careful studies have shown that the Vedic texts reflect two stages of development in
terms of literature as well as social and cultural evolution. The Rigveda which is the
oldest Vedic text reflects one stage of social and cultural development whereas the
other three Vedas reflect another stage. The first stage is known as the Rigvedic period
or Early Vedic period and the later stage is known as the Later Vedic period. The age of
the Early Vedic period corresponds with the date of the composition of the Rigvedic
hymns. This date has been fixed between 1500 BC and 1000 BC. The later Vedic
period is placed between 1000 BC and 600 BC. Recently, the Rigveda has been in-
cluded by the UNESCO in the list of literature signifying World Human Heritage.

3. What kind of texts are included in the category known as shruti? Mention them.
4. Explain the contents of the Brahmana category of texts.
5. Explain the term vedanta.
4.2 MIGRATION OF THE ARYANS
The authors of the Vedic hymns were the Aryans. But who were the Aryans? In the
19th century, Aryans were considered a race. Now it is thought of as a linguistic
group of people who spoke Indo-European language from which later emerged San-
skrit, Latin, and Greek etc. This is reflected from the words in these languages which
are similar in sound and meaning. Thus the Sanskrit words matri and pitri are similar
to the Latin mater and pater. Similarly, Inar of the Hittite (Turkey) language is similar
to Indra of the Vedas. Suryyas and Maruttash of the Kassite (Mesopotamia) inscrip-
tions are equivalent of the Vedic Surya and Marut.
Originally the Aryans seem to have lived somewhere in the Steppes stretching from
southern Russia to Central Asia. From here, a group of them migrated to northwest
India and came to be called Indo-Aryans or just Aryans. The archaeological evi-
dence of migrations comes from what is known as Andronovo Culture situated in south-
ern Siberia. This Culture flourished in the second millennium BC. From here people
moved to north of Hindukush (the area known as Bactria-Margiana  Archaeological
Complex) and from here they entered India. During the period between 1900 BC"

and 1500 BC we get, in these regions, evidence of horses, spoked wheels, fire cult
and cremation which formed important parts of Aryan life in India. Apart from these,
the artifacts and ceramics also suggest movement of people from Central Asian
region to South Asian region. However it may be noted that some scholars still argue
that the Aryans were the indigenous people of India and that they did not come from outside.
The new people came in several batches spanning several hundred years. All this while
interaction between the indigenous inhabitants and the newcomers continued. One of

4.3 GEOGRAPHICAL HORIZON OF THE VEDIC ARYANS
The early Vedic Aryans lived in the area known as sapta-sindhu meaning area of seven
rivers. This area largely covers the northwestern part of South Asia up to river Yamuna.
The seven rivers included Sindhu, Vitasta (Jhelum), Asikni (Chenab), Parushni (Ravi),
Vipash (Beas), Shutudri (Sutlej) and the Sarasvati. In this area the Rigvedic people lived,
fought battles, grazed their herds of cattle and other domesticated animals. Gradually
moving eastward, they came to occupy eastern U.P. (Kosala) and north Bihar (Videha)
during the Later Vedic period. Here they came into contact with the people who spoke
languages different from their own and were living in this area for long.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 4.3
1. List the rivers included in the collective term sapta-sindhu.
2. With which regions did the Aryans come into contact in the Later Vedic period?
4.4 EARLY VEDIC ECONOMY
The early Vedic Aryans were pastoralists. Cattle rearing was their main occupation. They
reared cattle, sheep, goats, and horses for purposes of milk, meat and hides. We arrive at this
conclusion after analyzing the literary evidence in the Rigveda. A large number of words are
derived from the word go meaning cow. A wealthy person was known as gomat and the
daughter called duhitri which means one who milks the cow. The word gaveshana literally
means search for cows, but it also means battle since many battles were fought over cattle.
The cows were thought of as providers of everything. Prayers are offered for increase in the
number of cattle. All the above and many more references show that cattle breeding was the
most important economic activity of the Rigvedic Aryans.
However, this is not to suggest that the early Vedic people had no knowledge of agricul-
ture. The evidence for agriculture in comparison with pastoral activities in the early"

portions is meager and mostly late insertions. A few references show that they had
knowledge of agriculture and practiced it to supplement their food requirements. They
produced yava (modern jau or barley), which was rather a generic word for cereals.
Apart from cattle-rearing and small-scale cultivation, people were engaged in many
other economic activities. Hunting, carpentry, tanning, weaving, chariot-making, metal
smeltry etc. were some such activities. The products of these activities were exchanged
through barter. However, cows were the most favoured medium of exchange. The
priests received cows, horses and gold ornaments as fees for performing sacrifices.

HISTORY
 The Vedic Age (1500BC–600BC)
4.5 CHANGES IN THE LATER VEDIC PHASE
During later Vedic phase, agriculture became the mainstay of the Vedic people. Many
rituals were introduced to initiate the process of agriculture. It also speaks of plough-
ing with yokes of six and eight oxen. The buffalo had been domesticated for the
agricultural purposes. This animal was extremely useful in ploughing the swampy
land. The god Indra acquires a new epithet ‘Lord of the Plough’ in this period. The
number and varieties of plant food increased. Apart from barley, people now culti-
vated wheat, rice, pulses, lentils, millet, sugarcane etc. The items of dana and dakshina
included cooked rice. Thus with the beginning of food production agricultural produce
began to be offered in the rituals. Tila, from which the first widely used vegetable
food-oil was derived increasingly, came to be used in rituals.
The main factor in the expansion of the Aryan culture during the later Vedic period
was the beginning of the use of iron around 1000 BC. The Rigvedic people knew of a
metal called ayas which was either copper or bronze. In the later Vedic literature ayas
was qualified with shyama or krishna meaning black to denote iron. Archaeology has
shown that iron began to be used around 1000 BC which is also the period of later Vedic
literature. The northern and eastern parts of India to which the Aryans later migrated
receive more rainfall than the north-western part of India. As a result this region is
covered with thick rain forests which could not be cleared by copper or stone tools used
by Rigvedic people. The use of iron tools now helped people clear the dense rain forests
particularly the huge stumps left after burning, in a more effective manner. Large tracts
of forestland could be converted into cultivable pieces in relatively lesser time. The iron
plough could turn the soil from deeper portions making it more fertile. This process
seems to have begun during the later part of the Rigvedic period but the effect of iron
tools and implements become evident only towards the end of the Later Vedic period.
There has been a continuous increase in the population during the later Vedic period due
to the expansion of the economy based on agriculture. The increasing number and size of
Painted Grey Ware (PGW) settlements in the doab area shows this. With the passage of
time the Vedic people also acquired better knowledge of seasons, manuring and irrigation.
All these developments resulted in the substantial enlargement of certain settlements such
as Hastinapur and Kaushambi towards the end of the Later Vedic period. These settle-
ments slowly began to acquire characteristics of towns. Such rudimentary towns inhab-
ited mainly by the chiefs, princes, priests and artisans were supported by the peasants
who could spare for them some part of their produce voluntarily or involuntarily.

4.6 THE EARLY VEDIC SOCIETY
The family was the basic unit of the Rigvedic society. It was patriarchal in nature
Monogamy was the usual norm of marriage but the chiefs at times practiced po-
lygamy. Marriages took place after attaining maturity. After marriage the wife went
to her husband’s house. The family was part of a larger grouping called vis or clan.
One or more than one clans made jana or tribe. The jana was the largest social
unit. All the members of a clan were related to each other by blood relation. The
membership of a tribe was based on birth and not on residence in a certain area. Thus the
members of the Bharata tribe were known as the Bharatas. It did not imply any territory.
The Rigvedic society was a simple and largely an egalitarian society. There was no caste
division. Occupation was not based on birth. Members of a family could adopt different
occupations. However certain differences did exist during the period. Varna or colour was
the basis of initial differentiation between the Vedic and non-V edic people. The Vedic people
were fair whereas the non-Vedic indigenous people were dark in complexion and spoke a
different language. Thus the Rigveda mentions arya varna and dasa varna. Here dasa
has been used in the sense of a group different from the Rigvedic people. Later, dasa came
to mean a slave. Besides, certain practices during this period, such as concentration of larger
share of the war booty in the hands of the chiefs and priests resulted in the creation of some
inequalities within a tribe during the later part of this Vedic phase.
The warriors, priests and the ordinary people were the three sections of the Rigvedic
tribe. The sudra category came into existence only towards the end of the Rigvedic
period. This means that the division of society in the early V edic period was not sharp.
This is indicated by the following verse in the Rigveda: “I am a poet, my father is a
physician and my mother grinds grain upon the stone. Striving for wealth, with varied
plans, we follow our desires like cattle.”
The women in society enjoyed respectable position. She was married at a proper age
and could choose a husband of her own choice. She could take part in the proceed-
ings of the tribal assemblies called sabha and samiti.

4.7 SOCIAL CHANGES IN THE LATER VEDIC PHASE
The family remains the basic unit of the Vedic society. However, its composition under-
went a change. The later Vedic family became large enough to be called a joint-family
with three or four generations living together. The rows of hearths discovered at
Atranjikhera and at Ahichchhtra (both in western Uttar Pradesh) show that these were
meant for communal feeding or for cooking the food of large families. The institution of
gotra developed in this period. This means that people having common gotra descended
from a common ancestor and no marriage between the members of the same gotra
could take place. Monogamous marriages were preferred even though polygamy was
frequent. Some restrictions on women appeared during this period. In a text women
have been counted as a vice along with dice and wine. In another text a daughter has
been said to be the source of all sorrows. Women had to stay with her husband at his
place after marriage. The participation of women in public meetings was restricted.
However, the most important change was the rise and growth of social differentiation in
the form of varna system. The four varnas in which society came to be divided were the
brahmanas, kshatriyas, vaishyas and shudras. The growing number of sacrifices and ritu-
als during the period made the brahmanas very powerful. They conducted various rituals
including those related to different stages of agricultural operations. This made them all the
more important. The kshatriyas, next in the social hierarchy, were the rulers. They along
with brahmanas controlled all aspects of life. The vaishyas, the most numerous varna
were engaged in agriculture as well as in trade and artisanal activities. The brahmanas and
the kshatriyas were dependent on the tributes (gifts and taxes) paid to them by the vaishyas.
The shudras, the fourth varna were at the bottom of the social hierarchy. They were
ordained to be in the service of the three upper varnas. They were not entitled to the ritual
of upanayana samskara (investiture with sacred thread necessary to acquire educa-
tion). The other three varnas were entitled to such a ceremony and hence they were
known as dvijas. This can be construed as the beginning of the imposition of disabilities on
the shudras as well as the beginning of the concept of ritual pollution.
Another important institution that began to take shape was ashrama or different stages
of life. Brahmacharya (student life), grihastha (householder), and vanaprastha (her-
mitage) stages are mentioned in the texts. Later, sanyasa, the fourth stage also came to
be added. Together with varna, it came to be known as varna-ashrama dharma.

4.8 THE EARLY VEDIC RELIGION
The prayers to propitiate gods for physical protection and for material gains were the
main concerns of the Rigvedic people. The Rigvedic gods were generally personifica-
tions of different aspects of natural forces such as rains, storm, sun etc. The attributes
of these gods also reflect the tribal and patriarchal nature of the society as we do not
find many goddesses mentioned in the text. Indra, Agni, Varuna, Mitra, Dyaus, Pushana,
Yama, Soma, etc. are all male gods. In comparison, we have only a few goddesses such
as Ushas, Sarasvati, Prithvi, etc which occupy secondary positions in the pantheon.
The functions of different gods reflect their needs in the society. Thus, since the
Rigvedic people were engaged in wars with each other they worshipped Indra as a
god. He is the most frequently mentioned god in the Rigveda. He carried the thunder-
bolt and was also respected as a weather god who brought rains. Maruts the god of
storm aided Indra in the wars in the way tribesmen aided their leader in the tribal wars.
Agni, the fire god was the god of the home and was considered an intermediary be-
tween gods and men. Soma was associated with plants and herbs. Soma was also a
plant from which an intoxicating juice was extracted. This juice was drunk at sacrifices.
Varuna, another important deity, was the keeper of the cosmic order known as rita.
This rita was an important aspect of tribal set-up. Pushan was the god of the roads,
herdsmen and cattle. In the life of the pastoral nomads, this god must have been very
important. Other gods were similarly associated with other aspects of nature and life.
All these gods were invoked and propitiated at yajnas or sacrifices. These sacrifices
were organized by the chiefs of the tribes and performed by priests. Gods thus in-
voked in the sacrifices supposedly rewarded the sacrificers with success in wars,
progeny, increase in cattle and long life. It also brought large number of gifts in the
form of dana and dakshina to the priests.
It is important here to note that during the entire Vedic phase people did not construct temples
nor did they worship any statue. These features of Indian religion developed much later.

4.9 CHANGES IN THE LATER VEDIC PHASE
We have already noted that in the later Vedic period agriculture had become an
important activity of the people. Changes in the material life naturally resulted in a
change in their attitude towards gods and goddesses too. Continuous interactions
with the local non-Aryan population also contributed to these changes. Thus, Vishnu
and Rudra which were smaller deities in the Rigveda became extremely important.
However, we do not have any reference to different incarnations or avataras of
Vishnu, we are so familiar with, in any of the Later Vedic texts.
Another important feature was the increase in the frequency and number of the
yajna  which generally ended with the sacrifices of a large number of animals. This
was probably the result of the growing importance of a class of brahmanas and their
efforts to maintain their supremacy in the changing society. These yajnas brought to
them a large amount of wealth in form of dana and dakshina. Some of the impor-
tant yajnas were - ashvamedha, vajapeya, rajasuya etc. You must have heard
about these yajnas in the stories of the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. In these
yajnas which continued for many days a large part of gifts went to the brahmanas.
The purpose of these yajnas was twofold. Firstly, it established the authority of the
chiefs over the people, and secondly, it reinforced the territorial aspect of the polity
since people from all over the kingdom were invited to these sacrifices.
You will find it interesting to know that people began to oppose these sacrifices
during the later Vedic period itself. A large number of cattle and other animals which
were sacrificed at the end of each yajna must have hampered the growth of economy.
Therefore, a path of good conduct and self-sacrifice was recommended for happi-
ness and welfare in the last sections of the Vedas, called the Upnishads . The
Upnishads contain two basic principles of Indian philosophy viz., karma and the
transmigration of soul, i.e., rebirth based on past deeds. According to these texts real
happiness lies in getting moksha i.e. freedom from this cycle of birth and re-birth.

4.10 THE EARLY VEDIC POLITY
We have mentioned above that the chief social unit of the Aryans was known as
jana. The chief of this unit was the political leader called rajan. The main function
of the chief was to protect the jana and cattle from the enemies. He was helped in
his task by the tribal assemblies called sabha, samiti, vidatha, gana and parishad."

Notes
 The Vedic Age (1500BC–600BC)
Out of these sabha and samiti were the most important assemblies. All aspects of
life were discussed in these assemblies. These may include wars, distribution of the
spoils of wars, judicial and religious activities etc. Thus these assemblies in a way
limited the powers of the chiefs. Interestingly, women were also allowed to partici-
pate in the deliberations of the sabha and samiti.
The post of the chief was not hereditary. The tribe generally elected him. Though the
succession in one family was known but that was not based on the rule of primogeniture
(i.e., the eldest son acquiring the position). The purohita assisted and advised the chief on
various matters. Other than the purohita, there were a limited number of other officials
who assisted the chief in the day-to-day tribal affairs. Senani, kulapa, gramani, etc. are
some of the functionaries which find mention in the Rigveda. The sena or army was not
a permanent fighting group and consisted of able bodied tribesmen who were mobilized at
the time of the wars. Takshan, the carpenter and rathakara, the chariot maker were
responsible for making chariots. There is no official mentioned as a collector of taxes. The
people offered to the chief what is called bali. It was just a voluntary contribution made by
the ordinary tribesmen on special occasions. All this shows that the early Vedic polity was
an uncomplicated system based on the support and active participation of all the tribes-
men. This situation, however, changed during the later Vedic phase.

1. Explain the functions of sabha and samiti.
2. What was the main function of the rajan?
3. What was the nature of bali during the Early Vedic period?
4. Make a list of the main functionaries who helped the chief in various matters.
4.11 CHANGES IN THE LATER VEDIC PHASE
The changes in the material and social life during the later Vedic period led to changes
in the political sphere as well. The nature of chiefship changed in this period. The
territorial idea gained ground. The people started to loose their control over the chief
and the popular assemblies gradually disappeared.
The chiefship had become hereditary.  The idea of the divine nature of kingship gets a
mention in the literature of this period. The brahmanas helped the chiefs in this process.
The elaborate coronation rituals such as vajapeya and rajasuya established the chief
authority. As the chiefs became more powerful, the authority of the popular assemblies
started waning. The officers were appointed to help the chief in administration and they
acquired the functions of the popular assemblies as main advisors.
A rudimentary army too emerged as an important element of the political structure
during this period. All these lived on the taxes called bali, the shulka, and the bhaga
offered by the people.
The chiefs of this period belonged to the kshatriya varna and they in league with the
brahmanas tried to establish complete control over the people in the name of dharma."

WHAT YOU HA VE LEARNT
After the decline of the Harappan urbanism, we witness the coming of a new kind of
people on the northwestern horizon of India. These people were animal herders and
spread out in groups from the Southern Russia to different parts of the world. Many
such groups reached India through Afghanistan at different periods. Their language,
known as Indo-Aryan or Sanskrit became predominant with borrowings from the
local languages.Their earliest compositions are known as the Rigveda and many
more compositions followed subsequently. We get to know about the culture of these
people from these collections known as the Vedas.
The Aryans initially lived in the region drained by seven rivers Septa Sindhu roughly
covering the modern states of Punjab, and Harayana. Subsequently they also occu-
pied the region drained by Ganga, Yamuna, Sarayu, Ghaghra, and Gandaka roughly
covering the modern states of eastern Uttar Pradesh and western Bihar.
The Aryans, who were mainly cattle herders, became agriculturists later, and as-
sisted by the knowledge of iron technology they were able to establish larger settle-
ments in the Ganga- Yamuna doab region. This is shown by the PGW archaeology
and the contents of the Later Vedic literature. This change precipitated a series of
changes in the other spheres of life. From an egalitarian, tribal socio-political set up
during the Early Vedic period it was transformed into a varna divided territorially
based set up by the end of the Vedic period. The position of the tribal chiefs became
hereditary and the emerging officials usurped the role of the popular assemblies. The
growing number of yajnas shows the importance of the king as well as of the
brahmanas. Similarly, the gods who were important earlier lost their significance and
gave way to new deities. All these changes ultimately resulted in the rise of janapadas
and mahajanapadas i.e. bigger territorial states in the sixth century BC.

FROM JANAPADAS TO EMPIRE

Notes
In the last chapter we studied how later Vedic people started agriculture in the Ganga
basin and settled down in permanent villages. In this chapter, we will discuss how
increased agricultural activity and settled life led to the rise of sixteen Mahajanapadas
(large territorial states) in north India in sixth century BC. We will also examine the
factors, which enabled Magadh one of these states to defeat all others to rise to the
status of an empire later under the Mauryas. The Mauryan period was one of great
economic and cultural progress. However, the Mauryan Empire collapsed within fifty
years of the death of Ashoka. We will analyse the factors responsible for this decline.
This period (6th century BC) is also known for the rise of many new religions like
Buddhism and Jainism. We will be looking at the factors responsible for the emer-
gence of these religions and also inform you about their main doctrines.
OBJECTIVES
After studying this lesson, you will be able to
 explain the material and social factors (e.g. growth of agriculture and new social
classes), which became the basis for the rise of Mahajanapada and the new
religions in the sixth century BC;
 analyse the doctrine, patronage, spread and impact of Buddhism and Jainism;
 trace the growth of Indian polity from smaller states to empires and list the six-
teen Mahajanapadas ;
 examine the role of Ashoka in the consolidation of the empire through his policy
of Dhamma;
 recognise the main features– administration, economy, society and art under the
Mauryas and
 Identify the causes of the decline of the Mauryan empire.
5.1 THE EMERGENCE OF NEW RELIGIONS
In this period, the centre of economic and political activity shifted from Haryana and
western UP to Eastern UP and Bihar, which had more rainfall and better fertility of
land. As it was now easier to exploit the iron ore resources of Bihar and adjoining
regions, people started using more and more iron tools and ploughshare to clear thick
forest cover and cultivate the hard soil of this area.

Notes
From Janapadas to Empire
The evidence of the growth of agriculture comes from the archaeological and literary
sources of this period. In fact, a ploughshare dated to around 500 BC has been found
from Jakhera in Etah district in western U.P. Many other important pieces of evi-
dence of the use of iron in this period come from Rajghat, Kaushambi, Vaishali and
Sonpur. The Buddhist texts tell us how cultivation of paddy, sugarcane and mustard
required utmost care and several rounds of ploughing. Expansion of agriculture re-
sulted in improved food supply and helped in the development of craft production,
trade and urban centres.
The sixth century BC is known as an era of ‘Second Urbanisation’ in the
Indian Subcontinent. After the decline of the Harappan Towns urban centres
now emerge again after a gap of more than a thousand years. However , this
time towns developed in the middle Ganga basin and not in the Indus plain. It
is said that more than sixty towns and cities such as Pataliputra, Rajagriha,
Sravasti, Varanasi, Vaishali, Champa, Kaushambi and Ujjaini developed be-
tween 600 and 300 BC. These cities became centre of craft production and
trade, and were inhabited by a large number of artisans and m erchants. The
goods produced by artisans like textile, silk, jewellery , pottery etc, were car-
ried by merchants to other towns. Varanasi was a major centre of trade con-
nected with Sravasti and Kausham bi. Sravasti was also connected with Vaishali
through Kapilavastu and Kusinara. Jataka stories tell us that traders trav-
elled from Magadh and Kosala via Mathura to Taxila. Mathura was the tran-
sit point for travel to Ujjain and coastal areas of Guj arat also.
Development of trade is reflected in the discovery of thousands of coins
known as punch marked coins (PMC). Various kind of marks such as cres-
cent, fish, trees, hill etc. are punched on these coins, they are therefore
called Punched Marked Coins. Numismatists have identified nearly 550 types
of such coins, made mainly of silver and sometimes copper .
The improvem ent in agriculture and dev elopment of trade, money and
urbanisation had an impact on the society as well. Indeed, due to these
changes traditional equality  a nd brotherhood gave way to inequality  a nd
social conflict. People wanted some kind of reprieve from new social prob-
lems like violence, cruelty , theft, hatred, and falsehood. Therefore, when
new relig ions such as Jainism  and Buddhism preached the concept of peace
and social equality , people welcomed it. These relig ions emphasised that
true happiness does not lie in material prosperity or performance of rituals
but in charity , frugality , non-violence, and good social conduct. Besides, the
general economic prog ress had led to the rise of vaisyas and other mercan-
tile groups, who wanted better social position than what brahmanas gave
them. Therefore, they preferred to patronise non-vedic religions like Bud-
dhism and Jainism  through substantial donations.
Buddhism and Ja inism were not the only religions, which challenged
brahmanical dominance. According to the Buddhist sources, more than 62
sects and philosophies flourished in this period. One of these sects was
known as Ajiv ika, which was founded by Makkhali Goshal. Ajivakas were
very popular in Magadh in the third century BC and Mauryan kings donated
several caves in the honour of Ajivaka m onks.

5.2 DOCTRINES OF JAINISM AND BUDDHISM
Jainism
Vardhaman Mahavira, is regarded as the founder of Jainism. He was born in 599 BC
near Vaishali in Bihar. He was twenty-fourth and the last tirthankara of Jainism. Jainism
believed that the main goal of human life is the purification of soul and attainment of
nirvana, which means freedom from birth and death. This can be achieved not through
rituals and sacrifices but by pursuance of triratna and panchamahavrata. Triratna or
three jewels are right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, which can lead to libera-
tion. Right conduct means observance of five great vows: ahimsa (do not commit vio-
lence) satya vachana (do not speak a lie), asteya (do not steal), brahmacharya (do
not indulge in sexual act) and aprigraha (do not acquire property). Householders were
expected to observe milder form of the practice of these virtues called anuvrata (small
vows) in comparison to the monks. So, one can notice that while the Brahmanism was
a ritual oriented religion this new faith was conduct-oriented.
The most distinguishing feature of Jainism was the concept of anekantavada or
syadavada. It means that the truth can be viewed from aneka or various angels.
Another important feature of Jainism was its emphasis on extreme form of penance,
austerity, and strict non-violence Perhaps emphasis on strict discipline was one of the
reasons why it could not attract the masses in large number. Mahavira used Prakrit
language to spread his message. However, just like other religions, Jainism also could
not remain united for very long and later divided into two sects called the Digambara
(who remain naked) and Svetambara (who wear white clothes).
Buddhism
The founder of Buddhism was Gautama Buddha, who was born in 566 BC at
Lumbini, located in the foothills of Nepal. One night he left his palace in search of
truth and ultimately attained the true knowledge at Bodhgaya. He then began to
be called Buddha or the enlightened one. He delivered his first sermon at Sarnatha
near Varanasi. This event is known as dharma-chakra-pravartana  ( turning  o f
the wheel of law). He also established his samgha here. He died at the age of 80
in 486 B.C. at Kusinara or Kusinagar near Gorakhpur in eastern UP .
Buddha asked his followers to avoid the two extremes of indulgence in worldly plea-
sure and the practice of strict abstinence and asceticism. This philosophy of madhyama
marga or the Middle Path is reflected in all the issues related to Buddhism. The main

Notes
From Janapadas to Empire
teachings of Buddhism are encapsulated in the basic concept of four noble truths or
arya satya and eightfold path or astangika marga. The first noble truth, Buddha said
that suffering (dukkha) is the essence of the world and is like an ocean of miseries.
Second noble truth is dukkha samudya i.e. every suffering has a cause. Third noble
truth is dukkha nirodha i .e. suffering c ould be extinguished and fourth dukkha
nirodha gamini pratipada i.e. there is a path leading to the extinction of dukkha.
He said that every thing in this world like birth, old age and death leads to suffering. If
one wants to get rid of suffering one has to conquer the desire. This removal of desire
can be achieved through eight fold path, these are: right faith, right resolve, right
speech, right action, right living, right effort, right thought, right self concentration.
Buddha used Pali language spoken by masses to propagate his teachings. Buddha allowed
lower varnas and women to join the sangha. Four Buddhist councils organised over differ-
ent periods played a significant role in the propagation of Buddhism. In the fourth council
during the reign of Kanishka, Buddhism split into two major sects called Hinayana and
Mahayana. Mahayana adopted Sanskrit as its language and started worshipping Buddha in
the form of an idol, while Hinayana continued to follow Pali and treated Buddha as a guide.
Buddhism became weak by seventh century AD but the impact of Buddhism can be seen
in all spheres of life in Indian history. Buddhist scholars created many literary texts like
Tripitaka, Milindapanho, Buddhacharita etc. Buddhism became an inspiration for the
promotion of art and architecture, in the form of stupas, rock cut caves and paintings.
These can be noticed at Sanchi, Bharhut, Amravati, Ajanta etc. Buddhism inspired
Gandhara and Mathura schools of art. Buddhism by opening its door to all the classes
challenged the superiority of Brahmanism and gave better social position to lower castes.

HISTORY
From Janapadas to Empire
5.3 THE SIXTEEN MAHAJANPADAS
The sixth century BC was not only a period of socio-economic and religious development
but it also witnessed new political developments. In the later Vedic period, as we have
seen earlier, people had started agriculture, which made them settle down at a particular
place. These permanent settlements led to foundation of janapadas or territorial states
under the control of the king. In the sixth century BC the main area of political activity
gradually shifted from Western UP to Eastern UP and Bihar. This region was not only
fertile on account of better rainfall and river systems but was also closer to iron produc-
tion centres. The use of better iron tools and weapons enabled some territorial states to
become very large and they came to be called mahajanapadas. Most of them were
situated north of Vindhyas, between Bihar in the east to the northwest frontier of the
subcontinent. The list of these sixteen mahajanapadas is given below.
Table 5.1
The Mahajanpadas
Most of these states were monarchical in nature but some of them, called
ganasangha, h ad an oligarcharical system o f governance. In t his system unlike
monarchies, where a hereditary king rules, administration was run by an elected king
with the help of a large council or assemblies comprising heads of all important clans
and families. This system was certainly more democratic than monarchy, though the
common man had no participation in the administration. The most important of these

HISTORY
From Janapadas to Empire
5.4 THE RISE OF MAGADH
The political fight among these mahajanapadas led ultimately to one of them namely Magadh
to emerge as the most powerful state and the centre of a vast empire. The earliest important
ruler of Magadh was the king Bimbisara, who ruled for 52 years from 544 BC to 492 BC. He
pursued a three-pronged policy, namely, matrimonial alliances, friendship with strong rulers and
conquest of weak neighbours to expand the empire. Under the policy of matrimonial alliances,
he married the sister of Prasenjit, the king of Kosala. She brought in dowry the territory of
Kashi, which yielded a revenue of 1,00,000 coins. The control over Kasi and friendship with
Prasenajit allowed Magadh to concentrate on other areas. His other wives were daughters of
the chiefs of Lichchavi and Madra (middle Punjab) respectively. He also conquered Anga by
defeating its ruler Brahmadatta. Anga and specially its capital Champa were important for the
inland and maritime trade. Thus, Kashi and conquest of Anga became the launching pad for
the expansion of Magadh. He was a contemporary of both Buddha and Mahavira and paid
equal respect to them. It seems that he was either killed or forced to commit suicide by his son
Ajatasatru, who was eager to take over the throne himself.
Ajatasatru was an aggressive person and first came into conflict with his maternal uncle
Prasenajit, who was aggrieved by the treatment meted out to Bimbisara. He asked
Ajatasatru to return the territory of Kasi, which was given to his mother in dowry.
Ajatasatru refused and it was only after a fierce battle Prasenajit agreed to leave Kasi
with Magadh. Similarly he fought with his maternal grandfather Chetak, the chief of
Vaishali and after 16 long years of war Ajatasatru succeeded in breaking the might of
Vaishali. Therefore, he not only retained Kasi, but also added Vaishali to Magadh.
Ajatasatru was succeeded by Udayin and his main contribution was building a fort on the
confluence of river Ganga and river Son at Pataliputra or Patna. It was strategically a
significant step as this site was not only centrally located but also allowed easy movement
of merchant and soldiers.
Udayin was succeeded by the dynasty of Shishunaga. The most important achieve-
ment of Shishunaga was to defeat Avanti(Malwa) and make it a part of Magadh. The
successor of Sisunaga was his son Kalashoka. It was during his rule the second
Buddhist council was held.
The Shisunaga dynasty was succeeded by the kings of the Nanda dynasty. Mahapadma
Nanda was its most important ruler. According to the Brahmanical texts he belonged to a
low caste or at least a non-kshatriya caste. He possessed a large army and added Kalinga
to his empire. The last Nanda king was Dhannanand. He is believed to be an arrogant and
oppressive ruler who imposed heavy taxes on the common man. It made them quite
unpopular among the masses and ultimately Chandragupta took advantage of this public
resentment and uprooted the Nanda rule and set up the Mauryan Empire.
The question is how Magadh could establish gradually its dominance over all other states
of the period. Magadh certainly benefited from numerous able and ambitious rulers, but its
strength was based primarily on certain geographical factors. Its earlier capital Girivraja or
Rajagir was surrounded by five hills, which helped it to provide natural fortification. Sec-
ondly, its fertile river plain provided a vast amount of agricultural surplus, which was
essential for raising a vast standing army. Forests in southern areas gave it timber and
elephants. Magadh had another advantage in its control over iron deposits found very
near south Bihar. Such access to iron made Magadhan weapons far superior and agri-
culture tools more productive. It was this material background which helped Magadh to
become more powerful than other mahajanapadas.

Mauryan Sources
The establishment of Mauryan dynasty by Chandragupta Maurya in 321 B.C. marks
a turning point in the history of early I ndia. For the first time now, we have at our
disposal a number of sources which throw better light on the history of this period. The
edicts issued by Ashoka are the most important source of information and there are at
least 44 such edicts which have been found inscribed on rocks and pillars. These are
composed mostly in Prakrit language and are written in Brahmi script in most of the
areas. These inscriptions are also the first evidence of writing in ancient India. As far as
archaeological sources are concerned, punch-marked coins, remains of the palace of
Ashoka at Kumharar and several pieces of sculptures are important.
The most important literary sources are Arthasastra of Kautilya and Indica of
Megasthenes. Arthasastra is a text on statecraft, which gives advice to kings as to how
to rule his land and discharge his duties. Indica is an account left by a Greek ambassador
Megasthenes sent by Seleucus to the court of Chandragupta Maurya. Two Ceylonese

Mauryan Dynasty
The founder of the Mauryan dynasty, Chandragupta Maurya (321–297 BC) inherited a
large army of the Nandas, which he used to conquer almost whole of north, the north-
west, and a large part of the peninsular India. His son Bindusara (297–269BC) suc-
ceeded him. He promoted trade and cultural interaction with Greeks, but not much is
known about him. Ashoka (269–232BC) succeeded his father Bindusara. According
to Buddhist traditions he came to throne after killing his 99 brothers, but such stories
cannot be trusted without confirmation from other sources. Ashoka fought a major
war with Kalinga around 261 BC in which large number of people were killed or
imprisoned. Perhaps this bloodshed moved his heart and he decided to abandon the

5.4 ASHOKA  AND HIS DHAMMA
Ashoka is considered as one of the greatest kings in Indian history. He is praised not
so much for his militaristic activity as for his policy of Dhamma. According to some of
scholars Ashoka was a follower of Buddhism and through Dhamma he tried to propa-
gate the principles of Buddhism But this does not seem to be true as Dhamma had
nothing to do with the propagation of Buddhism. It was a code of conduct or ideal
social behaviour common to all religions of the world, which he appealed to his sub-
jects to follow. Although Ashoka himself believed in Buddhism, he never discrimi-
nated against other faiths or religions.
A closer look at Asokan edicts illustrates that basic attributes of Dhamma included
compassion (daya), charity (dana), truthfulness, purity and gentleness. Pillar Edict
III asks subjects to control violence, cruelty, anger and envy. Rock edict I call for a
ban on animal sacrifice and social gatherings like samaj. The Rock Edict II declares
measures to be taken for the construction of hospitals, roads, inns, wells and planting
of shade giving trees. Third, Fourth and Twelfth rock edicts ask people to respect
parents, relatives, brahmanas and shramanas(monks). He also appointed a special
type of officials called dhamma mahamatras. Their main function was to over see
and supervise the peaceful function of the principles of Dhamma. Twelfth rock edict
is specially important since it says “ the king Piyadassi, the beloved of the gods, respected
all sects whether ascetics or householders, and he honours them with gifts and honours of
various kinds…let an alien sect also be respected on every occasion.” It shows clearly
that neither Dhamma was Buddhism nor Ashoka was trying to convert people to Bud-
dhism. However, the question is why did he give so much attention to this policy?
Historians believe that by the later half of Ashoka’s rule, expansion of the empire was
almost complete. It was an empire having different cultural, social and religious groups.
In order to save the empire from political tensions arising out of these differences
there were two ways. He could either increase the size of armed forces to seek
military solutions to these conflicts, which might have needed increased taxes and in
turn could lead to more resistance. Another alternative was peaceful resolution of

5.7  DECLINE OFTHE MAURYAS
Mauryas maintained a huge army, a vast bureaucracy and ruled over a large part of
the Indian subcontinent. But soon after the death of Ashoka the empire got divided
into two parts. While king Dasaratha controlled the eastern part of the empire, the
western part was under Samprati. Why did such a large empire decline so early?
Some historians believe that Ashoka under the influence of Buddhism became a paci-
fist and weakened his army. It is also said that the religious policy of Ashoka antagonised
the brahmanas as he banned the animal sacrifice, which affected the economic and
religious activities of the brahmanas. Therefore, Pusyamitra, the brahmana chief of
the army, killed the last Mauryan king. But this does not seem to be correct as the
study of Ashokan inscriptions reveals that Ashoka paid full respect to brahmanas.
Moreover it is true that Ashoka followed a policy of peace and harmony, but he did
not disband his army and was always prepared to face any eventuality.
One of the main reasons for decline could be the succession of weak rulers.
Who could not keep under check those, ministers and officials of far-flung re-
gions, who had become oppressive and acted against the interest of the centre. It
is also possible that Mauryan rule may have suffered some kind of economic
crisis. It is reflected in the debasement of some coins of that period. This crisis
might have developed either due to massive donations and charity or overspend-
ing on the imperial administrative system. In fact, the reason of decline was
inherent in the structure of the vast centralized empire itself. The successors of
Ashoka could not maintain the balance between the centre and the various pro-
vincial governors of the empire, and at the first possible opportunity , they made
an effort to separate themselves from the centre. However, Mauryan empire
though declined had a positive effect of spreading agriculture and iron technol-
ogy in the different parts of the subcontinent. It facilitated the rise of several
regional kingdoms in the post-Mauryan period.

The Mauryas established an elaborate system of administration in which king played

final decisions regarding revenue, law and order, war or any other matter related to
administration. He was expected to be agile and accessible to his officials at all times.

him any time. He also declared that all his subjects were like his children and he
desired their happiness in this and the other world.
The king appointed a council of ministers called mantriparishad. There were various
other officials, who helped him perform his duties. These officials were known as
amatyas, mahamatras and adhayakshas. Arthasastra gives a list of 27 adhayakshas
or superintendents who were responsible for running various economic departments
like agriculture, mining, weaving, trade, etc.
Among all the executive officials samaharta was the most important. His responsibility was
to supervise collection of taxes from all types of sources. Most of the superintendents men-
tioned above, functioned on his orders. The Mauryas also employed a large number of spies.
The Mauryans maintained a huge army and according to Greek writer Justin,
Chandragupta had 6,00,000 infantry, 30,000 cavalry, 9,000 elephants, 8,000 chariots.
Although, it seems to be an exaggerated figure but possession of a large army by the
Mauryas cannot be doubted. Megasthenes reports that administration of different
branches of army was carried out through six committees of five members each. An
officer called antahpala was responsible for the security of frontier forts.
As far as judicial administration is concerned, the king was the supreme authority, but various
civil as well as criminal courts functioned at the local level right from village to province. It
seems most of the cases were disposed off at the village level by village elders.
Apart from Magadh with its capital at Patliputra, the Mauryan Empire was divided
into four other provinces with capitals at Taxila (northwestern India), Suvarnagiri
(southern India), Tosali (eastern India) and Ujjain (western India). These were put
under the control of royal princes called kumara.
The city administration of Patliputra, according to Megasthenes, was conducted by
six committees of five members each. Each committee was assigned different sub-
jects such as industry, foreigners, birth and death registration, trade and market regu-
lations and tax collection to look after. However, we are not sure whether the entire
Indian subcontinent had similar type of city administration. It seems that while central
province of Magadh was under strict supervision of the king, other far-flung areas
might have witnessed varied degree of administrative control.
Economy, Society and Art
The Mauryas as mentioned above maintained a huge standing army and employed a large
number of state officials. These soldiers and officials were paid in cash. As the normal taxes
were not considered sufficient to meet all the needs of the state and hence the state under-
took and regulated numerous economic activities to generate more and more resources.
The mainstay of economy in this period was agriculture. The Mauryan state founded
new agricultural settlements to bring virgin land under cultivation. People from overpopu-
lated areas and prisoners of war were brought to these new settlements to work on the
fields. These villages belonged to king and were looked after by government official called
sitadhyaksha or superintendent of agriculture. Besides state farms there were individual
land holders who paid a variety of taxes to the state. The importance of irrigation was fully
realised and peasants had to pay more tax on irrigated land. The bali or land tax was the
main item of revenue, levied at the rate of one sixth of the produce. Peasants had to pay
many other taxes like pindakara, hiranya, bhaga, bhoga etc. The exact nature of
which is not clear. Principal crops were various varieties of rice, barley, millet, wheat,
sugarcane and most of the pulses, peas and oilseeds, which we know today.

HISTORY
From Janapadas to Empire
Trade and urban economy received great impetus under the Mauryas and influenced
almost all parts of the empire. The main centres of textile manufacturing were Varanasi,
Mathura, Bengal, Gandhara and Ujjain. Mining and metallurgy was another important
economic activity. Trade was conducted through land and river routes. Patliputra was
also connected through various trade routes with all parts of the subcontinent. The
main centre of trade in the northwest was Taxila, which was further connected with
central Asian markets. Tamralipti (Tamluk in west Bengal) in the east and Broach in
the west were important seaports.
Craft activities were also a major source of revenue to the state. Artisans living in
towns had to pay taxes either in cash or kind or work free for the king. Traders and
artisans were organised in associations called srenis or guilds. The Mauryas were
responsible for introduction of iron on a large scale in different parts of the subconti-
nent. They maintained a monopoly over production of iron, which was in great de-
mand by the army, industry and agriculture. It was done through the official called
loha-adyaksha .
As far as society is concerned, despite the challenge posed by Buddhism and Jainism
the varna system continued to exist and brahmanas and kshatriyas dominated the
social hierarchy. However, as a result of greater trade and commerce, there was
improvement in the social status of vaisyas or trading communities and shudras. Now
shudras could be involved in the agricultural and artisanal activities. This period also
saw increase in the number of untouchables.
The Mauryan period provides the earliest examples of ancient Indian art and
architercture. Megasthenes has described the grandeur of the Mauryan palace
at Pataliputra. Some remains of this palace have been found at Kumrhar near
Patna. Ashokan pillars at Rampurva, Lauriya Nandangarh and Sarnath present
excellent examples of stone sculptures which developed in this period. Our na-
tional emblem comes from the Asokan pillar at Sarnath near Benaras. All these
pillars are circular and monolithic, and are made of sand stone found at Chunar,
near Mirzapur in U.P. We also find some rock cut architecture like Lomasa Risi
cave in the Barabara hills near Gaya belonging to the Mauryan period. Among
several stone and terracotta sculptures of this period, polished stone sculpture of
a chauri- bearing female known as Didarganj Yakshini is most famous.

WHATYOU HAVE LEARNT
The use of iron tools and cattle-power in the fertile middle Ganga plain led to the
increase of agricultural productivity and the food supply in the sixth century BC. This
development of agriculture resulted in growth of towns, trade and money economy.
That is why the sixth century B.C. is also known as a period of ‘second urbanisation’.
In this period, some non-vedic religions like Buddhism and Jainism responded to the
new social realities and argued for a ban on cattle sacrifice, money-lending and urban
lifestyle. They advocated better social status for trading communities, who in turn

patronised these new religions. The main teachings of Jainism are triratna a nd
panchamahavrata, while Gautam Buddha asked people to follow four noble truths
and eight-fold path. The Janapadas of earlier times consolidated in this period and
resulted in the rise of sixteen mahajanapadas. Some janapadas followed the non-
monarchical system of governance. Ultimately, the utilisation of favourable geographical
condition by the ambitious rulers of Magadh resulted in its rise as an empire. Later on
Mauryas uprooted the Nanda dynasty and established their rule. They maintained a
highly centralised bureaucracy along with a vast army, and administered a large part
of the Indian Subcontinent. One of the greatest Indian rulers Ashoka adopted the
policy of Dhamma, which was aimed at consolidation of the empire and resolving
internal conflicts through peaceful means. After the death of Ashoka the Mauryan
Empire declined due to inefficiencies of later rulers and unstable relationship between

Notes
In the last chapter you read about the Mauryan Empire which was spread over a
large part of the Indian sub-continent and also included Kandahar in modern
Afghanistan. In around 187 BC, the Mauryan Empire met its end. In the present
section we shall study about the political and cultural developments in the Indian
subcontinent from the end of the Mauryas to the rise of the Guptas, i.e., from
BC 200 and 300 AD. In these five hundred years we see not only the rise of multiple
political powers in different parts of the subcontinent but also the introduction of new
features in art, architecture and religion.
OBJECTIVES
After studying this lesson, you will be able to learn about
 the different political regions which came into focus after the decline of the
Mauryan Empire

 the growth of trade between the Roman world and India and its impact.
 important features of various schools of art and sculptures which emerged dur-
ing 200 BC–300 AD and
 the early history of south India and the significance of the Sangam literature.
6.1 POLITICAL HISTORY OF NORTH INDIA
The disintegration of the Mauryan empire led to the rise of many regional kingdoms in
different parts of the country. At the same time, we witness invasions by various groups of
people based in Central Asia and western China. These were Indo-Greeks, the Scythians or
the Shakas, the Parthians or the Pahlavas and the Kushanas. It was through such political
processes that India came in closer contact with the central Asian politics and culture.
(i) The Shungas
The last Mauryan king was killed by his Commander-in-Chief, Pushyamitra Shunga,
who then established his own dynasty in north India. It came to be known as Shunga
dynasty. While the Shungas were ruling in north India, the Indo- Greeks also known
as Yavanas, about whom we shall study in some details later, emerged in Bactria
(Balkh) as an independent power and soon started extending their rule in the north-
western and northern parts of India. There are indications that Pushyamitra Shunga"

HISTORY
  Post Mauryan Developments
came in conflict with Demetrius, a Bactrian Greek ruler without suffering much politi-
cal damage. An inscription engraved on a pillar at Besnagar (present day Vidisha)
refers to one Heliodorus, native of Taxila near Rawalpindi in Pakistan, as an envoy of
an Indo-Greek ruler Antialkidas in the court of Bhagabhadra, who has been identified
with one of the later Shunga rulers. According to the inscription he was devotee of
Lord Krishna.
In around the second quarter of the first century BC, the last of the Shunga rulers was
killed treacherously by his minister Vasudeva, who then laid down the foundations of
the Kanva dynasty. We know virtually nothing about the Kanvas except for the rather
cursory references to them in later texts.
(ii) The Bactrians or the Indo-Greeks
After the death of Alexander in 323 BC, many Greeks came to settle on the northern
western boarders of India with Bactria (area to the north-west of the Hindukush
mountains in the present day north Afghanistan) as an important centre. The rulers of
Bactria came to be called the Bactrian-Greeks because of their Hellenistic (Greek)
ancestry. One of the rulers of the line named Demetrius as mentioned above came
into conflict with Pushyamitra.
However, the most celebrated Indo-Greek ruler was Menander. His empire appears
to have included southern Afghanisthan and Gandhara, the region west of the R.
Indus. He has been identified with king Milinda mentioned in the famous Buddhist
text Milindapanho  which contains philosophical questions that Milinda asked
Nagasena (the Buddhist author of the text) and informs us that impressed by the
answers, the king accepted Buddhism as his religion. Menander is believed to have
ruled between c. 155 BC and 130 BC.
(iii) The Shakas
Shaka is the Indian term used for the people called Scythians, who originally belonged
to central Asia. Defeated by their neighbours the Yueh-chis (the tribal stock to which
the Kushanas belonged) they gradually came to settle in northwestern India around
Taxila in the first century B.C Under the successive Shaka rulers their territories
extended up to Mathura and Gujarat.
The most famous of all the Shaka rulers was Rudradaman who ruled in the middle of
second century AD. His empire was spread over almost whole of western India. His
achievements are known through the only inscription that he got engraved on a boul-
der at Girnar or Junagarh. This inscription happens to be the first royal inscription of
early India composed in chaste Sanskrit.
(iv) The Parthians
The Parthians were of Iranian origin and because of strong cultural connection with
the Shakas, these groups were referred to in the Indian sources as Shaka-Pahlava.
The important inscription indicating the Parthian rule in northwestern area of Pakistan
is the famous Takht-i-Bahi inscription recovered from Mardan near Peshawar. The
inscription, dated in 45 AD, refers to Gondophernes or Gondophares as a Parthian
ruler. Some literary sources associate him with St. Thomas, who is said to have con-
verted both, the king and his brother, to Christianity."

6.2 THE KUSHANAS
The Kushanas, originally belonged to western China. They are also called Yueh-chis. The
Kushanas after defeating Shakas and Pahlavas created a big empire in Pakistan. The first
prominent ruler of the Kushana dynasty was Kujula Kadphises. He was succeeded by his
son Wema Kadphises. Next ruler was Kanishka. He was the most famous of the Kushanas.
He probably ascended the throne in AD 78, and started a new era, now known as the Shaka
era. It was under Kanishka that the Kushana empire reached its maximum territorial limits.
His empire extended from Central Asia to north India and included Varanasi, Kaushambi
and Sravasti in Uttar Pradesh. The political significance of Kanishka’s rule lies in the fact
that he integrated central Asia with north India as part of a single empire. It resulted in the
intermingling of different cultures and increase in inter regional trading activities.
Kanishka is famous in history as a great patron of Buddhism. He convened the fourth
Buddhist Council at Kundalavana (present day Harwan near Srinagar in Jammu and
Kashmir) in which a large number of Buddhist scholars took part. It was in this council
that Buddhism got split into two schools – Hinayana and Mahayana. Kanishka also pa-
tronized the Gandhara and Mathura schools of sculptural art about which you will learn
later in this chapter. He built in the city of Purushpura (present day Peshawar), his capital,
a giant stupa to house the Buddha’s relics. The building was still intact with all its magnifi-
cence when the Chinese pilgrim Fa-hsien visited the area later in the early fifth century
AD. The Kushana power gradually declined from the early third century AD.
(i) Kushana Polity and Administration
Nothing much is known about the administrative machinery of the Kushanas. Per-
haps the whole empire was divided into provinces, each ruled by a mahakshatrapa
( a military governor), who was assisted by a kshatrapa; but how many provinces
were there in the empire, is not known. Sources indicate that Kushana horsemen
wore trousers while riding. A headless statue of Kanishka found at Mathura reflects the
same. A prominent feature of Kushana polity was the title of devaputra, i.e., son of
God, used by the Kushana kings. It indicates the claim to divinity by the Kushana kings."

(ii) Contribution of the Kushanas
The Kushanas occupy a special place in the ancient Indian history because of their
contribution to various aspects of life. Their vast empire helped in the growth of
internal and external trade. It resulted in the rise of new urban centres. The rich state
of economy under the Kushanas is also evidenced by the large number of gold and
copper coins that they struck.
Even in literature and medicine, India made progress. Charaka, known as father of
Ayurveda, wrote a book on medicine called Charaksamhita whereas Asvaghosha, a
Buddhist scholar, wrote Buddhacharita, a full length biography of the Buddha. Both
these scholars were believed to be the contemporaries of king Kanishka. The Kushanas
patronized the Gandhara and the Mathura schools of sculptural art which are known
for producing the earliest images of Buddha and Buddhisattavas.

3. Where and under whose patronage did the fourth Buddhist council took place?
4. Who was Charaka?
6.3 CONTACTS WITH CENTRAL ASIA
Invasions of the Bactrian Greeks and Saka-Pahilavas on India and its subsequent
political contact with Central Asia under the Kushanas resulted in immense cul-
tural intermingling between the two regions. These foreign groups gradually lost
their foreign identity and were incorporated in the Brahmanical society lower
grade as kshatriyas . Many of them adopted Buddhism. We have already re-
ferred to the Indo-Bactrian ruler Menander who was converted to Buddhism by a
monk named Nagasena.
Central Asian contacts also brought to India new methods of making coins. The crude
punch-marked coins which were used earlier gradually gave way to refined Greek
style coins containing legends and the bust of the ruler. This new format became the
model for the subsequent coinage in India. Besides, Indians also borrowed from cen-
tral Asians, particularly the Greeks, knowledge of astronomy. Early Indian literary
works on astronomy frequently quote the Greek astronomers who are referred to as
yavanacharya. Indians also learned the art of making horoscopes from the Greeks.
Central Asian contacts brought a fresh wave in the art of sculpture making. Buddhist
sculptures of the Gandhara school, as explained here below, evolved as a result of the
amalgamation of the Indian and the Greek styles."

6.4 EMERGENCE OF EARLY STATES IN ORISSA AND THE DECCAN
We know that the Deccan as well as eastern India were parts of Ashoka’s empire.
He had conquered Kalinga through a violent battle in which loss of men and property
was enormous. It was as a result of the Mauryan rule in these regions that after its
decline we notice the emergence of kingdoms in Kalinga and the Deccan for the first
time in the Indian history.
Kalinga
After Ashoka, Kalinga (present day Orissa) became prominent under the kings of
Chedi dynasty. Unfortunately we have no information about the kings of the dynasty
except Kharavela. His achievements are recorded on an inscription, known a
Hathigumpha inscription, situated in the Udayagiri hills near Bhuvaneshvar in Orissa.
The inscription is so named because the image of an elephant is carved out of stone
next to the boulder carrying the inscription. The inscription tells us that he was a
follower of Jainism and had fought many successful battles against his neighbours.
He probably lived in the first century BC.

first century BC. Gautamiputra Satakarni (first century AD) is considered to be the great-
est of the Satavahana rulers. He is credited with the extension of Satavahana dominions
by defeating Nahapana, the Shaka ruler of Western India. His kingdom is said to have
extended from river Krishna in south to river Godavari in north. The Satavahanas had their
capital at Pratishthana (modern Paithan) near Aurangabad in Maharashtra.
The Satavahana kingdom was wiped out in the first quarter of the third century AD
and the Satavahanas kings were succeeded by the Kings of lkshvaku dynasty.
Satavahana Polity and Adminstration
Satavahana kingdom was divided into subdivisions called aharas or rashtras, meaning
districts. The lowest level of administration was a grama which was under the charge of
a Gramika. There were also officers called amatyas who were perhaps ministers or
advisors of the king. Revenue was collected both in cash and kind. Satavahanas kings
were the first in Indian history to make tax free land grants to Buddhists and Brahmanas
to gain religious merit. This practice became more prominent in succeeding periods. The
Satavahana kings claimed to be Brahmanas and considered it their primary duty to uphold
varna system i.e. the four fold division of social structure."

6.6 TRADE AND COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES
(i) Internal and External Trade Routes
The most important feature of the post-Mauryan period was the growth of trade and
commerce, both internally as well as externally. There were two major internal land
routes in ancient India. First, known as Uttarapatha, connected northern and eastern
parts of India with the northwestern fringes, i.e., present day Pakistan and further
beyond, and the second, known as Dakshinapatha, connected the peninsular India
with the western and northern parts of India.
The Dakshinapatha was the major route that connected north and south India. It
started from Kaushambi near Allahabad and running through Ujjaiyini (modern Ujjain)
extended further up to Bhrigukaccha or Broach, an important port on western coast.
The Dakshinapatha was further connected with Pratishthana (modern Paithan), the
capital of the Satavahanas.
As regards external trade routes, after the discovery of monsoons by Hippatus a
Greek navigator in 45 AD, more and more sea voyages were used for trading pur-
poses. Important ports of India on the western coast were (from north to south direc-
tion) Bharukachchha Sopara, Kalyana, Muziris, etc. Ships from these ports sailed to
the Roman Empire through the Red Sea.
Trade with southeast Asia was conducted through the sea. Prominent ports on the eastern
coast of India were Tamralipti (West Bengal), Arikamedu (Tamil Nadu Coast) etc. Sea
trade was also conducted between Bharukachchha and the ports of Southeast Asia.
(ii) Trade with West and Central Asia
An important feature of the commercial activities in the post-Mauryan period was the
thriving trade between India and the West, where the Roman empire was at its height.
Initially this trade was carried out through land, but owing to frequent obstructions
created by the Persians, who ruled the areas through which these trade routes passed,
the focus was shifted to sea routes. Now ships could move directly from Indian ports
to the ports on Red Sea and Persian Gulf.
The best account of Indo-Roman trade is given in the book called Periplus of the
Erythrean Sea which was written in the first century AD by an anonymous author.
Main requirements of the Romans were the Indian products such as spices, per-
fumes, jewels, ivory and fine textiles, i.e. muslin. Spices exported from India to the
Roman empire included pepper, also called yavanapriya (perhaps because of its
popularity among Romans). The spice trade with the Roman empire was largely
based in south India. Romans also imported several precious and semiprecious stones
like diamond, carnelian, turquoise, agate, sapphire etc, besides pearls, indigo, sandal-
wood and steel etc."

Against this import Romans exported gold and silver to India. It is proved by a large
number of Roman coins of the first century AD found in the subcontinent. This indicates
an enormous drain of gold from the Roman empire towards India. Other important
items of export from the Roman empire included wine which is indicated by wine-
amphorae and sherds of Roman ware found in significant numbers at Arikamedu in
south India. Besides, the western traders also brought tin, lead, coral and slave girls.
(iii) Crafts and Industries
Crafts production started growing in this period with tremendous impetus, as trade and
commerce, both internal and foreign, was dependent to a great extent on the craft activi-
ties. The text called Milindapanho mentions 75 occupations of which 60 were associated
with crafts. The level of specialization was very high and there were separate artisans
working in gold, silver, precious stones etc. Ujjain was a prominent bead making centre.
Textile industry was another prominent industry. Mathura and Vanga (east Bengal) were
famous for variety of cotton and silk textiles. The discovery of some dying vats at some
sites in south India indicates that dying was a thriving craft in the area during this period.
The artisans in this period touched new heights of prosperity and there are numerous
inscriptions which refer to the donations made by artisans to monasteries.
(iv) Guilds
The communities of merchants were organised in groups known as Shreni or guilds under
the head called sreshthi. Another type of mercantile group was called sartha which
signified mobile or caravan trading corporation of interregional traders. The leader of such
a guild was called sarthavaha. Like merchants almost all craft vocations were also organised
into guilds, each under a headman called Jyestha. These included weavers, corn dealers,
bamboo workers, oil manufacturers, potters etc. The guilds were basically associations of
merchants and craftsmen following the same profession or dealing in the same commod-
ity. They elected their head and framed their own rules regarding prices and quality etc., to
regulate their business on the basis of mutual goodwill. They also served as banks and
received deposits from the public on a fixed rate of interest.

6.7 ART AND ARCHITECTURE
Art in the post-Mauryan period was predominantly religious. Two most important
features concerning art and architecture of this period are the construction of stupas"

HISTORY
  Post Mauryan Developments
and development of regional schools of sculpture. Idols of the Buddha were carved
out for the first time in this period. On account of contact with the foreigners from
northwest, a specific school of art called Gandhara School of art developed in this
period. It was influenced, to a great extent, by the Greek style or art forms.
(i) Stupas
A stupa was a large hemispherical dome with a central chamber in which relics of
the Buddha or some Buddhist monk were kept in a small casket. The base was
surrounded by a path for clockwise circumambulation (pradakshina), enclosed by
wooden railings which were later made in stone. Three prominent stupas of this
period are at Bharhut and Sanchi (both in M.P), which were originally built by Ashoka
but enlarged later, and Amravati and Nagarjunkonda (both in Andhra Pradesh).
The Bharhut stupa in its present form dates to the middle of the second century BC. It
is important for its sculptures. Its railings are made of red stone. Three big stupas were
constructed at Sanchi in this period. The biggest of the three, which was built originally
by emperor Ashoka, was enlarged to twice its size sometime in the second century BC.
A number of stupas were also constructed in south India during this period but none has
survived in its entirety. The Amravati stupa, situated at Amravati in Andhra Pradesh
took its final shape sometime in the second century AD. The sculptures on stupas are
drawn on the themes based on Jataka and other Buddhist stories.

(ii) Rock Cut Architecture
Apart from the stupas, this period also marks a progress in rock cut architecture. A large
number of temples, halls and places of residence for monks were cut out of the solid rocks
near Pune and Nasik in Maharashtra under the Satavahanas. The place of worship gen-
erally had a shrine cell with a votive stupa placed in the centre. This place was known as
a chaitya and the rock cut structure used as the residence for monks was called a vihara.
(iii) Schools of Sculptural Art
The first century witnessed the division of Buddhism in two parts, Hinayana and
Mahayana. Mahayana Buddhism encouraged Buddha’s worship as a god in human
form. As a result a large number of Buddha images were built in different regions.
There were three major schools of sculptural art which developed in this period. These
were: Mathura school of art, Gandhara School of art and Amravati school of art.
The Mathura School: The most prominent contribution of the Mathura school to the
contemporary art was the images of Buddha which were carved for the first time perhaps
in this art form. The Mathura artists used local red stone with black spots to make the
images. Mathura has also yielded large numbers of sculptures of Jaina deities besides the
ayagapatas or stone slabs to place objects of worship. The Brahmanical influence on the
art school of Mathura is also evident. During the Kushana period a number of sculptures
of brahmanical deities were carved, which included Kartikeya, Vishnu, Kubera."

HISTORY
  Post Mauryan Developments
The Gandhara School of Art: The Gandhara region was situated in the northwestern
part of the Indian Subcontinent. This region was successively ruled by the Greeks, Mauryas,
Sungas, Shakas, and Kushanas for many centuries. The school of art which developed
here around the beginning of the Christian era has been called variously as Graeco-Ro-
man, Indo Greek or Graeco-Buddhist. This is perhaps because this school has all the
influences-Roman, Greek and Indian. The theme of sculptures in predominantly Buddhist
but their style is Greek. The chief patrons of Gandhara art were the Shakas and Kushanas.
The stone used for making idols of Buddha and Bodhisattava was predominantly
blue-grey schist. Chief characteristics of Gandhara school of art lies in its beautiful
portrayal of human figures with distinguished muscles of the body. Buddha is depicted
with a garment draped in Graeco-Roman fashion, and with very curly hair. These
beautiful images of the Buddha are ranked among the best pieces of sculptures.
The Amravati School of Art: The Amravati school of art flourished in the region of
Andhra Pradesh between the lower valleys of rivers Krishna and Godavari. The main
patrons of this art form were the Satavahans but it carried on even later, patronized by
their successor Ikshavaku rulers. This art is said to have flourished between 150 BC and
350 AD. Sculptures of this school are mainly found on the railings, plinths and other parts
of stupas. The thematic representations include the stories from the life of the Buddha.
 An important characteristic of the Amravati school is the ‘narrative art’. The medal-
lions were carved in such a manner that they depict an incident in a natural way. For
example one medallion depicts a whole story of ‘taming of an elephant by the Bud-
dha’. Another important feature of Amravati art is the use of white marble like stone
to carve out the figures. There is prominence of human figures rather than of nature.

6.8 EARLY HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA
(i) The Megalithic Cultures of South India
The neolithic phase of south India, which was highlighted by the use of polished stone
axe and blade tools, was succeeded by the Megalithic cultures (1200 BC–300 BC)
Megaliths were tomb spots consisting of burials or graves covered with huge (mega)
stones. They were, in most cases, located outside the settlement area. These Mega-
lith burials have yielded the first iron objects from south India. Besides these the use
of Black and Red ware pottery was also a distinctive feature of the Megalithic people.
These Megaliths have been found in large numbers from the Nagpur area in
Maharashtra in north to the southern tip of the Indian Peninsula. Prominent sites that
have yielded Megalith graves include Brahmagiri, Maski, (Karnataka). Adichallanur
(Tamilnadu) and Junapani near Nagpur (Maharastra).
Identical iron tools have been found universally from all the Megalith graves. These
tools which indicate their craft activities and include arrowheads, daggers, swords,
spearheads, tridents, battle axe, hoes, ploughshares, sickles etc. These artifacts,
alongwith the food grains such as wheat, rice etc., found at various megalithic sites
indicate that the megalithic people followed for their livelihood agro-pastoral and hunting
activities. The megalithic period in south India was followed by the Sangam age.
(iii) The Sangam Age
The Sangam age refers to that period in the early history of south India when large
numbers of poems in Tamil were composed by a number of authors. The term Sangam
refers to an assembly or “meeting together” of Tamil poets. Traditionally, three Sangams

or assemblies are believed to have been convened one after the other. All the three
Sangams took place at different places under the patronage of the Pandya kings of
Madurai. Poems within the Sangam literature were composed on two broader themes
of love and war. It was later put together in eight collections called Ettutogai. This
literature is believed to have been composed between 300 BC and 300 AD. A re-
markable feature of the Sangam literature is its vivid portrayal of the contemporary
society and culture of Tamilaham, or Tamil region and its peaceful and harmonious
interaction with the northern (Aryan) culture.
Tamilaham stretches between the hills of Tirupati and the tip of Kanyakumari. It was
divided amongst large number of chieftains and the chieftainship was hereditary. The
important chieftains who dominated Tamil region during Sangam Age were the Cholas,
with their capital at Uraiyur, the Cheras with their capital at Vanji, (near Karur) and
Pandyas with their capital at Madurai. The Cholas, Pandyas and Cheras had several

subordinate chiefs. Tribute from subordinate chiefs along with plunder, were the main
sources of revenue. There was frequent conflicts between the Cheras, Cholas and
Pandyas. It gave large scope to the Sangam poets to compose poems on war.
The whole Tamilaham in this period was divided into five tinais or eco-zones, i.e.,
zones based on their economic resources. These were: kurinji (hilly region); palai
(arid zone); mullai (pastoral tracts); marudam (wet lands); and neital (seacoast).
These zones were not clearly demarcated, and were scattered all around the region.
Because of their different geographical contexts and ecological specialties people in
different tinais had their own modes of subsistence. For example, in kurinji, it was
hunting and gathering; in palai, where people could not produce anything they took to
raiding and plundering; in mullai people practiced animal husbandry; in marudam it
was plough agriculture; and in neital people took to fishing and salt making.
Though the concept of varna was known, social classes in the Sangam period were
not marked by higher or lower rankings as in north India. For example, Brahmans
were present in the society and they performed vedic ceremonies and sacrifices and
also acted as advisers to the chief but they enjoyed no special privileges. People were
known on the basis of their occupation they followed, such as artisans, salt mer-
chants, textile merchants, etc. The rich lived in well decorated brick houses and wore
costly clothes whereas the poor lived in mud huts and had scanty clothes to wear.
War heroes occupied a special position in society, and memorial stones called nadukal
or virukkal were raised in honour of those who died in fighting, and they were wor-
shipped as godlings. Women in the Sangam period appear to have been educated.
This is testified by many poems contributed by women poets to the Sangam literature.
Women are also described as engaged in various economic activities such as paddy
plantation, cattle rearing, basket-making, spinning, etc. However, the cruel practice of
Sati was also prevalent in Tamil society, and it was known as tippayadal. But it was
not obligatory as there are references to widows present in society. However their
position was miserable as they were prohibited to decorate themselves or participate
in any form of amusement.
The people were engaged in various economic activities such as agriculture, crafts and
trade. Paddy was the most important crop. It formed the main part of peoples’ diet and
also served as a medium of barter exchange for inland trade. Since Tamil region does
not have perennial rivers, the chief, wherever possible, encouraged agricultural activi-
ties by making tanks and dams. The Chola king Karikala of the Sangam age is credited
with constructing a dam on the river Kaveri. It is considered to be the earliest dam in the
country. Among the crafts, the most important was of spinning and weaving of textiles
cotton as well as silk. Salt manufacture was another important activity.
The most important feature of the Sangam economy was flourishing trade with the
Roman world. It is confirmed by the recovery of a large number of Roman gold coins
in south India. The discovery of monsoons and the use of direct sea route between
Indian coasts and the western world, as mentioned earlier, was the main reason for
the growth of this trade. It led to rise of important towns and craft centres in the Tamil
region. Vanji, identified with the present day Karur in Tamil Nadu, was the capital of
the Cheras and also an important centre of trade and craft. Muzris, i.e., Cranganore
on the south-west coast, was the foremost port of the Cheras. We are told that the
Roman ships laden with gold used to come here to take back large amounts of pepper.
Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas, is described in the Sangam poems as a large city"

enclosed by a wall. It was an important centre of fine textile and ivory working.
Korkai, in the Tirunnelveli district of Tamil Nadu, was an important Pandya port. It
was famous for its pearls. Uraiyur (Tiruchirapalli in Tamil Nadu), the capital of the
Cholas, was a grand city with magnificent buildings. Kaveripattinam or Puhar was the
main Chola port. The Sangam poems refer to the busy markets guarded by soldiers.
In the field of religion, Sangam period witnessed a close and peaceful interaction
between north Indian and south Indian traditions. The Brahmanas who performed
religious ceremonies popularized the worship of Indra, Visnu, Siva etc., in south India.
There are also references to the presence of Buddhists and Jainas in Tamil region.
The local people, particularly those of the hills, worshipped a deity called Murugan,
which in northern India come to be identified with Kartikeya, a war god.
In short, the Sangm literature through its poems on love and emotion ( aham) and
warfare and social behaviour ( puram) on the whole present a picture of political
conflict, social inequality and economic prosperity of early Tamil region during 300
BC–300 AD.

THE GUPTAS AND THEIR
SUCCESSORS (A.D.300–750)
7
Notes
After the decline of the Kushanas, north India witnessed the rise of the Gupta dy-
nasty. The rulers of this dynasty were able to establish a vast empire that included
almost the entire north India. The Guptas had certain material advantages that helped
them to carve an empire. They operated from eastern U.P. and Bihar which was very
fertile. They could also exploit the iron ores of central India and Bihar to their advan-
tage. Their period was marked by great progress in art, architecture and literature.
They ruled up to circa A.D.550. After their collapse there emerged various regional
kingdoms in north India. South India too witnessed the rise of two important kingdoms
under the Chalukyas and the Pallavas respectively during AD 550–750.
OBJECTIVES
After studying this lesson, you will be able to:
 explain the rise of the Gupta empire and the political achievements of its rulers;
 describe the emergence of regional kingdoms after the decline of the Guptas;
 analyse the nature of the Gupta and post-Gupta political structure;
 notify social and economic changes from c. A.D. 300–750;
 identify cultural developments with special reference to art and literature;
 learn about the consolidation of Brahmanical tradition and the emergence of
Pauranic religion;
 list the developments in science and technology;
7.1 POLITICAL  HISTORY
The Gupta dynasty was established by Shrigupta, who probably belonged to the vaishya
caste. He hailed from either Magadha (Bihar) or Prayaga (eastern U.P.). His son
Ghatotkacha, who carried the title of maharaja, appears to be some small king about
whom nothing much is known.
(a) Chandragupta I
The real founder of the Gupta empire was Chandragupta I (AD 319–334). The year
of his accession in A.D. 319 marks the beginning of the Gupta era. It was henceforth
used in all their records, and also those of their feudatories. He took the title of
maharajadhiraja (king of kings) . He married a Lichchhavi princess Kumaradevi.
This event is recorded in a series of gold coins issued by Chandragupta. It appears"

2. Give two material advantages that helped the Guptas to establish an empire?
3. How did the marriage alliance with the Lichchhavi’s help Chandragupta?
(b) Samudragupta
Chandragupta was succeeded by his son Samudragupta (A.D. 335–375).
Samudragupta followed a policy of conquest and enormously enlarged his kingdom.
His achievements are recorded in a long inscription (prashasti), written in pure San-
skrit by his court poet Harisena. The inscription is engraved on a Pillar at Allahabad.
It enumerates the people and the regions conquered by Samudragupta. He adopted a
different policy for different area conquered by him.
In the Ganga-Yamuna doab, he followed a policy of annexation. He defeated nine
naga rulers and incorporated their kingdoms in the Gupta empire. He then proceeded
to conquer the forest kingdoms of central India, mentioned as atavirajyas. The rulers
of these tribal areas were defeated and forced into servitude. This area had a strate-
gic value as it contained a route to south India. It enabled Samudragupta to proceed to
South along the eastern coast conquering twelve kings on the way and reached as far
as Kanchi near Chennai. Samudragupta, instead of annexing their kingdoms, liberated
and reinstated these kings on their thrones. This policy of political conciliation for
south India was adopted because he knew that it was difficult to keep them under
control and subservience once he returned to his capital in north. So it was enough for
him that these states recognized his suzerainty and paid him tributes and presents.
According to the Allahabad inscription, neighbouring five frontier kingdoms and nine
republican states of Punjab and western India were overawed by the conquests of
Samudragupta. They agreed to pay tribute and taxes to Samudragupta and obey his
orders without any fight. The inscription adds that Samudragupta also received trib-
utes from many kings of south - east Asia.
It is generally believed that though he had spread his influence over a vast area,
Samudragupta exercised direct administrative control mainly over Indo-Gangetic ba-
sin. He celebrated his conquests by performing a horse sacrifice (ashvamedha) and
by issuing ashvamedha type of coins (the coins portraying the scene of sacrifice) on
the occasion. Samudragupta was not only a conqueror but also a poet, a musician and
a patron of learning. His love for music is attested by his coins that represent him as
playing on a vina (lute)."

 The Guptas and Their Successors
(c) Chandragupta II
Samudragupta was succeeded by his son Chandragupta II (AD 375–414) also known
as Chandragupta Vikramaditya, he not only extended his father’s empire but also con-
solidated his position through matrimonial alliances with other royal dynasties of the
period. He married Kuvernaga, the Naga princess and had a daughter Prabhavati from
her. Prabhavati was given in marriage to Rudrasena II of the Vakataka dynasty ruling
in Deccan. After the death of her husband, Prabhavati ruled the territory as regent to
her minor son with the help of her father. The control of Vakataka territory proved very
beneficial to Chandragupta II, as he was now able to target his other enemies better.
His greatest military achievement was his victory over the Shaka kings who were
ruling in western India for the last three hundred years. This conquest made Gupta
empire reach up to the western coast.
An iron pillar inscription at Mehrauli in Delhi indicates that his empire included even
north-western India and Bengal. He took the title of Vikramaditya i.e. the one who
is as powerful as the sun. Chandragupta II is remembered for his patronage of art
and literature. He is credited with maintaining nine luminaries (navaratna) in his court.
The great Sanskrit poet and playwright Kalidasa was the most notable of them all.
The Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Fa Hien (AD 404–411) visited India during his reign.
He has left an account of the life of people in India in the fifth century AD.

(d) Decline
Chandragupta II was succeeded by his son Kumaragupta (AD 415–455). He was
able to maintain the empire built up by his father but during the later part of his reign
there was a threat from the Hunas of Central Asia. After occupying Bactria the
Hunas crossed the Hindukush Mountains and entered India. Their first attack during
his reign was repulsed by prince Skandagupta. The Guptas however could not pro-
tect their empire for long and the successive waves of Huna invasion made the
Gupta’s very weak. This was one of the main factors which accelerated the disinte-
gration of the Gupta empire.
The inscriptions issued by the Hunas show that by AD 485 they had occupied eastern
Malwa and a large part of central India. Punjab and Rajasthan also passed into their
hands. The first important ruler of the Hunas in India was Toramana who conquered
an area stretching up to Eran near Bhopal in central India. His son Mihirkula suc-"

ceeded him in AD 515. He is described in texts as a tyrant and an iconoclast. Both
Yashodharman of Malwa and Narasimhagupta Baladitya of the Gupta dynasty finally
defeated Mihirkula. But this victory over the Hunas could not revive the Gupta Empire.
Besides the Huna invasion there was also a gradual decline in economic prosperity. It is
indicated by the gold coins of later Gupta rulers, which have less of gold content and more
of alloy. We also notice a gradual disappearance of coins in the post Gupta period. It led
the kings to make payments in form of land rather than cash. It is evident by the discovery
of large-scale land grant charters donating land to brahmanas and officers.
The practice of giving land for religious and secular purposes in lieu of services ren-
dered to the State is normally termed as feudalism. Under this practice, the donee
(the one who receives the grant) was given the right not only to collect the taxes but
also to administer the donated land. This created small-small pockets of power trying
ceaselessly to expand their sphere of influence at the cost of the ruling authority.
The decline of the Gupta empire resulted in the emergence of numerous ruling dynas-
ties in different parts of northern India. The prominent among them were the
Pushyabhutis of Thanesar, Maukharies of Kanauj and the Maitrakas of Valabhi. The
political scene in the Peninsular India was no different. The Chalukyas and the Pallavas
emerged as strong regional powers in Deccan and northern Tamil Nadu respectively.

7.2 MAITRAKAS
The Maitrakas were tributary chiefs of the Guptas, who established an independent
kingdom in western India. Dhruvasena II was the most important ruler of the Maitrakas.
He was a contemporary of Harshavardhana and was married to his daughter. Hsuan
Tsang tells us that Dhruvasena II attended Harsha’s assembly at Prayaga (Allahabad).
Ruling over Saurashtra in Gujarat, the Maitrakas developed Valabhi as their capital.
This city became an important center of learning. Being on the Arabian Sea, it was
also a port town having flourishing trade and commerce. Maitrakas continued to rule
until the middle of the eighth century when Arab attacks weakened their power.
7.3 MAUKHARIES
The Maukharies ruled over Kanauj, a city in western Uttar Pradesh, which gradually
replaced Pataliputra as a political center of north India. Maukharies were also the
subordinate rulers of the Guptas and used the title of  samanta. Harshavardhana’s
sister Rajyashri was married to Grihavarman. Shashanka, the ruler of Bengal (Gaur),
and Devgupta, the Later Gupta ruler jointly attacked Grihavarman and killed him. The
kingdom of Kanauj was then merged with that of the Pushyabhutis and Harsha shifted
his capital from Thanesar (Kurukshetra) to Kanauj."

7.3 PUSHYABHUTIS OF THANESAR
An important ruling family to gain prominence after the fall of the Gupta was that
of the Pushyabhutis who had their capital at Thanesar (Thanesvara in
Kurukshetra). The dynasty became influential with the accession of
Prabhakarvardhana, who was able to defeat the Hunas and strengthen his posi-
tion in the regions of Punjab and Haryana. After his death, his elder son
Rajyavardhana came to the throne but he was treacherously killed by Shashanka,
the king of Bengal and Bihar. Harshavardhana then ascended the throne in AD
606. He was only sixteen years of age at that time. Still he proved himself to be
a great warrior and an able administrator. We have two valuable sources that
throw important light on the life and times of Harshavardhana (606–647). These
are Harshacarita written by his court poet Banabhatta and Si-Yu-Ki, the travel ac-
count of the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Hsuan Tsang, who visited India during AD
629–644.
After his accession Harshavardhana united his kingdom with that of his wid-
owed sister Rajayashri (see above) and shifted his capital to Kanauj and is de-
scribed as the lord of the north (sakalauttarapathanatha). He brought Punjab,
Uttara Pradesh, Bengal, Bihar and Orissa under his control. Harsha wanted to
extend his power in the Deccan. But he was defeated by Pulakesin II, the Chalukya
ruler, on the banks of river Narmada. The river thus became the southern bound-
ary of his kingdom.
The death of Harsha in AD 647 was followed by a political confusion that continued
up to the eighth century when the Gurjara Pratiharas, the Rajput rulers, emerged as a
big force in northern India.

In peninsular India the Vakatakas, were a local power that ruled over northern
Maharashtra and Vidarbha. Their history can be reconstructed on the basis of a large
number of land grant charters issued to the brahmanas. Rudrasena II of the royal
Vakataka family was married to Prabhavatigupta, the daughter of Chandragupta II of
the imperial Gupta family. Culturally the Vakataka kingdom is important because it
became a channel to spread brohamanical culture to south India."

7.6 CHALUKYAS (SIXTH-EIGHTH CENTURY A.D.)
The Chalukyas played a prominent role in the history of Deccan and south India for
about two hundred years from the beginning of sixth century A.D. They set up their
kingdom in western Deccan with capital at Vatapi (modern Badami in Karnataka).
The kingdom rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of Pulakesin II (AD 610–642).
He was the greatest ruler of the Chalukyas. He consolidated his authority in
Maharashtra and conquered large parts of Deccan. He defeated Harshavardhana in
circa AD 630 and acquired the title of dakshinapatheshvara (lord of the south).
However, he himself was defeated and killed by the Pallava king Narasimhavarman
in c. AD 642. It marked the beginning of a long drawn political struggle between the
Pallavas and Chalukyas that continued with ups and down for more than a hundred
years. In about AD 757 their feudatories, the Rashtrakutas, overthrew them. Cultur-
ally, their period is important for the growth of art and architecture in Deccan.

The Pallavas rose to power during the reign of Mahendravarman (AD 600–630) and
Narasimhavarman I (AD 630–668). Throughout their reign they were in constant con-
flict with Chalukyas of Vatapi in the north and the Tamil kingdoms of Cholas and Pandyas
in the south. Their rule in south India was replaced by the imperial Cholas. Culturally
their reign is important for the growth of Tamil bhakti literature and the Dravidian style
of art and architecture in south India. It was under them that Mahabalipuram, south of
Chennai, emerged as an important centre of temple architecture.

7.8 ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM (c.A.D.300–750)
In the Mauryan period, the political authority was concentrated in the hands of the king. But,
the Gupta administration was decentralized in nature. It means that feudatories i.e. local
Kings and smaller chiefs ruled a large part of their empire. The pompous titles such as
maharajadhiraja, parambhattaraka, parameshvara etc were adopted by the imperial
Guptas. These lesser rulers adorned their names with titles like raja and maharaja.
The kingship was normally hereditary. The king was the focus of administration.
Princes, ministers and advisors assisted him. The princes were also made the vice-
roys of the provinces. Provinces were known as desha, rashtra or bhukti and their
head was called uparika. The provinces were divided into a number of districts
called pradesha or vishaya. The administrative head of the vishaya was known as
vishayapati. The vishayas were further divided into villages. The village headman
called gramadhyaksha looked after the affairs of the village with the help of village
elders. The artisans and merchants took an active part in the town administration
during the Gupta period. The Gupta bureaucracy was less elaborate as compared to
that of the Mauryas. The high level central officers under the Guptas were called the
kumaramatyas. Important functionaries like mantri, senapati were all recruited from that"

cadre. Administrative posts were not only hereditary but often several offices were com-
bined in the hands of the same persons as in the case of Harisena, the composer of the
Allahabad pillar inscription of Samudragupta. He has been described as a
mahadandanayaka (chief judicial officer) as well as a mahasandhivigrahika (minister
for war and peace). The ruler himself often appointed high-ranking officers but the heredi-
tary nature of the post must have weakened the royal control over the administration.
During the Gupta period land taxes increased considerably. The land tax called bali
varied from 1/4th to 1/6th of the total produce. Two new agricultural taxes that appear
in Gupta inscriptions are uparikara and udranga. However, their exact nature is not
clear. In addition, the peasants had to meet the demands of the feudatories. They also
had to feed the royal army when it passed from the villages. The villagers were also
subjected to forced labour (vishti).
The judicial system was far more developed under the Gupta rulers than in earlier
times. For the first time civil and criminal laws were clearly demarcated. Disputes
connected with various type of property were considered in civil law. Elaborate laws
were laid down about inheritance. Theft and adultery fell under criminal law. The king
upheld the law and tried cases with the help of the brahmanas. The guilds of mer-
chants and artisans were governed by their own laws.
Harsha governed his empire on the same lines, as did the Guptas. But during his period the
administration became more decentralized and the number of feudatories grew further. In
Harsha’s time the officers and the religious persons were paid mainly in land. It encour-
aged the system of feudalism which grew much more in the post- Harsha period.
In the empire of Harsha law and order does not appear to be so well maintained.
Hsuan Tsang was twice robbed of all his belongings during his travels in India. On the
other hand Fa Hien had to face no such difficulty during Gupta period.

7.9 SOCIETY
The structure of the society was undergoing a change in the Gupta period. The
supremacy of the brahmanas was increasing. They were getting large-scale land
grants not only from the rulers but from other people also. The land was given along
with administrative rights and tax exemptions. Thus, a new class of brahmana land-
lords was created. Supported by the king, they tended to exploit the peasants.
We also notice a proliferation of castes in this period. With the extension of brahmanical
culture in distant and different areas, a large number of tribals were assimilated in the
brahmanical social structure of varna system fold, as were some foreigners such as
the Hunas. While the foreigners and tribals heads were included as kshtriyas, the
ordinary tribals were given the status of shudras.
The position of shudras however improved somewhat during this period. They were
allowed to listen to the epics and the puranas. They could also perform some domestic
rituals that were earlier prohibited for them. In the seventh century Hsuan Tsang calls
shudras as agriculturists and the vaishyas as traders. A distinction was also made be-
tween shudras and untouchables, the latter being treated lower in status than the shudras.
The untouchables are referred to as chandalas. They lived outside the village and dealt
in unclean jobs such as scavenging or butchery. The Chinese traveler Fa-Hien tells us
that whenever they entered the towns or market places they would strike a piece of
wood to announce their arrival, so that the others might not touch them and get polluted.
References to slaves are found in the contemporary Dharmashastras (Law Books).
Narada mentions fifteen types of slaves. They were mainly domestic servants em-
ployed in cleaning and sweeping. The prisoners of war, debt bondsmen, born of a
slave woman were all considered slaves.
The status of women continued to decline in Gupta period. The main reason for the
subordination of women was their complete dependence on men for their livelihood.
The women were not entitled to inherit property. However, she had full right on her
stridhana i.e. the presents received by the bride at the time of her marriage. The free
representation of females in art suggest that there was no purdah system in the
society. However, there is evidence of the presence of sati system. The first evi-
dence of sati (immolation of widow) is found in an inscription (AD 510) at Eran in
Madhya Pradesh. In the Harshacarita of Bana, the queen performs sati on the
death of her husband king Prabhakaravardhana. Even Rajyashri, sister of Harsha
was about to perform sati when Harsha rescued her.

7.10 ECONOMY
The period from circa fourth century to eighth century was a period of great agricul-
tural expansion. The vast areas of land were brought under cultivation and improve-
ments were made in the existing methods of production to attain higher yield. One of
the reasons for it was the practice of granting lands to brahmanas and secular offic-
ers in different areas. It helped in bringing virgin land under the plough. The spread of
knowledge regarding the use of iron plough share, manure, irrigation and preservation
of cattle wealth in backward areas also contributed to rural prosperity. It however
brought no relief to peasants who continued to suffer tremendous tax burden.
The Gupta and post- Gupta period witnessed a comparative decline in country’s trade
and commerce. Till AD 550 India continued to have some trade with the eastern
Roman empire to which it exported silk, and spices. Around the sixth century the
Romans learnt the art of rearing silk worms. This adversely affected India’s foreign
trade in this precious commodity. The disruption of north-western route by the Hunas
was another factor for this decline. India tried to make up the loss by carrying on
trade with south-east Asian countries but it did not help revive the economy substan-
tially. The loss in trade lessened the inflow of gold and silver into the country. It is
confirmed by a general scarcity of gold coins after the Guptas.
The Guptas did issue a large number of gold coins called dinaras. But we notice that
the gold coins of each successive Gupta ruler, after Chandragupta II, contain less of
gold and more of alloy. After the Guptas very few coins of Kings of different dynas-
ties have been found. Thus in the absence of coinage we can presume that a self-
sufficient economic system with limited trade prevailed after the downfall of the Guptas.

7.11 LITERATURE
The Gupta period is considered as the Golden Age of art and literature.
A huge body of religious and secular literature was compiled in this period. The two
great epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata were finally completed in the fourth
century. The stories of both the epics symbolize the victory of good over evil. Both
Rama and Krishna came to be considered incarnation of Vishnu.
The Gupta period marks the beginning of the writing of the literature known as Puranas.
These texts refer to the stories about the Hindu gods and mention the ways to please
them through fasts and pilgrimages. The major Puranas written in this period are the
Vishnu Purana , Vayu Purana  and the Matsya Purana . For the worship of
Shiva, Shiv Purana was written whereas the various incarnations of Vishnu are
glorified in V araha Purana, Vamana Purana, and Narasimha Purana. They were
meant for the worship by common man. Some Smritis or the law books were also
compiled in the Gupta period. One of these, the Narada Smriti throws light on the
general social and economic rules and regulations of the period."

The literature in Gupta period was written in Sanskrit. The greatest of all the poets was
Kalidasa who lived in the court of Chandragupta II in the fifth century AD. His works are
very famous and have been translated in many European languages. Some of the works
that he authored are Meghadutam , Abhijnanashakuntalam , Raghuvamsha,
Kumarasambhava and Ritusamhara. The notable feature of his works is that the charac-
ters of higher caste speak in Sanskrit while those of lower caste and women speak in
Prakrit. The other famous dramatists to have flourished in this period are Shudraka, writer
of Mrichchhkatikam and Vishakhadatta who authored Mudrarakshasa.
In the seventh century Banabhatta, the court poet of Harsha, wrote Harshacarita
praising his patron. Written in an ornate style, it became a model for later writers. The
early history of Harsha is reconstructed on the basis of this text. Another text written
by him is Kadambari. Harsha too was considered to be a literary monarch. He is said
to have authored three plays: Priyadarshika, Nagananda and Ratnavali.
In south India, the period from AD 550–750 witnessed the growth of Bhakti literature
in Tamil. Songs were composed by the Vaishnava saints (Alvars) and Saiva saints
(Nayannaras) in praise of their respective gods. One of the most famous of the Alvar
saints was a woman called Andal. The Vaisnava devotional songs are later arranged
in a text called Nalayira Prabandham while those of the Saivites are preserved in

7.12 ART  AND  ARCHITECTURE
Ancient Indian art was mainly inspired by religion. As in earlier times, Buddhism gave a
great impetus to art in Gupta period also. A life size image of Buddha made in copper is
found from Sultanganj in Bihar. Beautiful images of Buddha were also created at Mathura
and Sarnath. The finest examples of Buddhist art during Gupta period are the paintings
of Ajanta caves. Depicting the life of Buddha and the Jataka stories, these paintings
with lustrous colors have not faded even after fourteen centuries. The Ajanta caves are
now included in the list of the World Heritage Sites by the UNESCO.
It is for the first time in the Gupta period that the temples in the form of structures
were constructed in north India. These temples were made in the architectural style
known as Nagara. Two of these temples, one made of bricks at Bhitargaon in Kanpur
and the other of stone at Deogarh in Jhansi have been found in Uttar Pradesh. Here
the images of Vishnu are placed in the center as a chief deity.
The Gupta coins are also pieces of art. They are well designed and meticulously
crafted. They carry aesthetically impressive depictions of the activities of the rulers."

out of a solid, piece of stone constructed by king Narasimhavarman at Mahabalipuram,
65 km from Chennai. The Pallavas also built many structural temples. One of the most
important among them is the Kailashnath temple, constructed in the eighth century.

7.13 RELIGION
The Gupta rulers gave patronage to Bhagvatism. But they were tolerant to other
religions too. The Chinese pilgrims Fa Hien and Hsuan Tsang, who came to India
during the reign of Chandragupta II and Harsha respectively, clearly give the impres-
sion that Buddhism was also flourishing. Harsha, though a Shaiva in his early life,
became a follower of Buddhism and a great patron of the religion. He convened an
assembly at Kanauj to publicize Mahayanaism. Nalanda developed as a great center
of education for Mahayana Buddhism during his time. Students from outside coun-
tries also came to study in this university. According to Hsuan Tsang the revenues of
one hundred villages supported it.
Bhagvatism centered on the worship of Vishnu and his incarnations. It put emphasis
on bhakti (loving devotion) and ahimsa (non killing of animals) rather than Vedic
rituals and sacrifices. The new religion was quite liberal, and assimilated the lower
classes in its fold. According to Bhagavadgita, the chief text of Bhagvatism, when-
ever there was a social crisis Vishnu would appear in a human form and save the
people. Thus ten incarnations of Vishnu were perceived. Puranas were written to
popularize the virtues of each one of these incarnations. The idols of gods were
housed in the temples constructed in Gupta period.
In south India, from the seventh century onwards the Tamil saints called Alvars and
Nayannaras popularized the concept of bhakti. Alvar saints popularized the wor-
ship of Vishnu and the Nayannar saints, the worship of Shiva.
We also notice the spread of Tantrism in India in this period. From the fifth century
the brahmanas had started receiving land in the tribal areas of Nepal, Assam, Bengal,
Orissa, central India and Deccan. As a consequence, the tribal elements came to be
assimilated in the brahmanical society. The brahmanas adopted their rituals, gods and"

goddesses. It is this assimilation of brahmanical religion and tribal practices which resulted in
the development of Tantrism. It did not believe in any caste or gender bias and admitted both
women and shudras in its ranks. It put emphasis on ‘female’ as a source of power and
energy. The Tantrik concepts affected, Shaivism and Vaishnavism as well as Buddhism and

7.14 SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
An idea of the progress of science and technology in the Gupta period can be had
from the important texts written on these subjects during this period. The most
notable among them is an astronomical text called Aryabhatiyam , written by
Aryabhatta in the fifth century. Aryabhatta was an astronomer and a mathema-
tician. He for the first time suggested that the earth rotates on its axis, and re-
volves around the sun and causes eclipse. He was the first to invent “zero” and
the use of the decimal system. Another scholar Varahamihira (end of sixth cen-
tury) was a great astronomer who has written a number of books on astronomy.
His work Panchasiddhantika  deals with five astronomical systems. Brahmagupta
a well known mathematician also lived in the Gupta period.
Metallurgy also saw technological advancement in Gupta times. The bronze images of
Buddha produced on a considerable scale in the period are an example of advanced
technology. The twenty-three feet high iron pillar at Mehrauli in Delhi too speaks volumes
of the iron technology prevailing in the Gupta period. Standing in the open, this pillar has not
gathered rust even after fifteen centuries. The wonderful paintings of Ajanta, still intact,
indicate besides other things, the art of making colors during this period.

 The Guptas and Their Successors
WHAT HA VE YOU LEARNT
Let us briefly recapitulate the main points of this lesson: Chandra Gupta I (AD 319–334)
was the real founder of Gupta empire. Guptas were able to establish a vast empire as
they could exploit the iron ores of central India and Bihar and also this being very fertile
land. He was succeeded by Samudrgupta (AD 335–375) and Chandra Gupta II (AD
375 – 414). Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Fa Hien (AD 404–411) visited India and has left
an vivid account of people of that period. Great Sanskrit poet and playwright Kalidasa
was one of the nine luminaries of Chandra gupta II. Hunas from Central Asia threat-
ened the Gupta empire & its invasion made Gupta’s very weak. Subsequently decline
in economic prosperity led to gradual decline of Gupta’s empire.
Harshavardhana (606–647), a great warrior and able administrator established kingdom in
north whose account is available in Harishcharita by his court poet Banabhatta. Chinese
Buddhist pilgraim Hsuan Tsang visited India during his time. Harsha was defeated by Pula
Kesin II Chalukya ruler of south, so river Namada become Harsha’s Southern boundary.
Pallavas rose to power in pennisular India. Tamil bhakti literature and Dravidian style
of art and architecture in South India developed during this period.
Society underwent a change during Gupta’s period. Brahmaincal culture extended to
distant and different areas. A large number of tribals were assimilated in the varna
system and some foreigners like Hunas were also stratified into Brahmanical system.
The status of women declined further in this period.
Gupta period is Golden age of Art and literature Ramayana and Mahabharata were
completed in 4 th century. Puranas began to be written. Alvars & Nayannaras, The
South India saints composed Bhakti literature in Tamil.
Nagara-North Indian temples and southern style Dravida temples came to be estab-
lished in their respective regions.
Ajanta Caves paintings depicting the life of Budha were also created during this
period. The famous Mahabalipuram rath temples are also a creation of this period.
Aryabhatiyam, a notable astro-nomical text written by Aryabhatta of 5th century stated
for the first time that the earth rotates on its axis and revolves around sun. Metullurgy
saw technological advancement in Gupta times. Mehrauli’s Iron pillar and bronze
images of Buddha are few examples of this advancement.

INDIA BETWEEN AD 750–1200
8
Notes
The period between AD 750 and AD 1200 is referred to as an early medieval period
of Indian History. It was earlier treated by historians as a ‘dark phase’. It was so
because during this time the whole country was divided into  numerous regional
states which were busy fighting with each other. But recent studies have indicated
that, though politically divided, India witnessed a growth of new and rich cultural
activities in the fields of art, literature and language. In fact, some best specimens of
temple architecture and Indian literature belong to this period. Thus, far from being
‘dark’ it may be treated as a bright and vibrant phase of Indian history.
OBJECTIVES
After studying this lesson, you will be able to:
 identify the various regional kingdoms which emerged during AD 750 and AD
1200;
 examine the nature of state;
 highlight the  social  and economic changes;
 evaluate the cultural activities;
 and assess the significance of India’s contact with Southeast Asia during 8th and
12th centuries;
8.1 POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS
The political developments after Harshavardhan, about whom you have read in the
last chapter, can be best understood if we divide the period from AD 750 to AD 1200
in two parts (a) AD 750–AD 1000; (b) AD 1000–AD 1200. The first phase was
marked by the growth of three important political powers in India. These were Gurjara
Pratiharas in north India, Palas in eastern India and Rashtrakutas in South India.
These powers were constantly fighting with each other with a aim to set up their
control on Gangetic region in northern India. This armed conflict among these three
powers is known as ‘Tripartite struggle’. In the second phase we notice the break up
of these powers. It resulted in the rise of many smaller kingdoms all over the country.
For example, in northern India, the disintegration of the Pratihara empire brought to
the forefront various Rajput states under the control of different Rajput dynasties
such as the Chahmanas (Chauhans), Chandellas, Paramaras. etc. These were the"

states which fought and resisted the Turkish attacks from northwest India led by
Mahmud Ghaznavi and Mohammad Ghori in the 11 th and 12th centuries, but had to
yield ultimately as they failed to stand unitedly  against the invaders.
Let us now trace briefly the history of the three powers we have mentioned above.
The Gurjara Pratihara dynasty was founded by Nagabhatta I in the region of Malwa
in the eighth century. He belonged to a Rajput clan.Later one of his successors,
Vatsaraja extended his rule over to a large part of North India and made Kannauj in
western Uttara Pradesh his capital. Vatsaraja’s policy of expansion brought him in
conflict with Dharamapala, the Pala King of Bengal and Bihar. Soon, the Rashtrakuta
king Dhruva from south India jumped into the fight. And thus began what is known as
‘Tripartite Struggle’ i.e struggle among three powers. It continued for about  the next
hundred  and fifty years under various succeeding kings with ups and downs. The
Gurjara-Pratiharas, however, could continue to maintain their hold over Kannauj  till
the last. One of the important kings of this dynasty was Mihira Bhoja (ninth century).

He was highly praised by an Arabian scholar Sulaiman for keeping his empire safe
from robbers.
In eastern India, Pala dynasty was founded by Gopala (8th century). As the names of
all the succeeding kings ended with ‘Pala’ this dynasty come to be known as the
‘Pala’ dynasty.The son and grandson of Gopala,viz; Dharmapala and Devapala greatly
extended the power and prestige of the Pala dynasty. Though their expansion towards
west was checked by the Pratiharas, the Palas continued to rule over Bihar and Bengal
for nearly four centuries with a small break. The Pala kings were the followers of
Buddhism. They  greatly promoted this religion by making monasteries (viharas) and
temples in eastern India. Dharmapala is known to have founded the famous Vikramashila
university near Bhagalpur in Bihar. Like Nalanda university, it attracted students from
all parts of India and also from Tibet. Many Sanskrit texts were translated into Tibetan
at this monastery. The most celebrated name associated with Vikramashila University
was that of Atisha Dipankara who was greatly respected in Tibet.
In south, Dantidurga was the founder of the dynasty called, Rashtrakuta dynasty (8th
AD). The capital of the Rastrakutas was Manyakheta or Malkhed near Sholapur. It
was under the king Dhruva that the Rashtrakutas turned towards north India in a bid
to control Kannauj, then the imperial city. And as mentioned above, it led to the begin-
ning of ‘Tripartite struggle’. One of the important kings of the Rashtrakuta dynasty
was Krishna I. He built the famous Kailasha temple at Ellora (near Aurangabad,
Maharastra). It is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is monolithic i.e. made of one single
piece of rock. The Arab accounts inform us that the Rashtrakutas were quite friendly
with the Arab traders who visited their empire. These traders were allowed to build
mosques and follow their religion without any hindrance. It testifies to the liberal
attitude of the Rashtrakuta kings and also to their desire to draw economic benefit
from the growing  sea trade conducted by the Arabs at that time.
In South India, the Chola Kings founded a mighty empire during AD 1000–AD 1200.
The relationship  between these Cholas, called the “Imperial Cholas” with the earlier
Cholas mentioned in the Sangam literature is not clear. The Cholas came to power
after over throwing the authority of the Pallavas in South India. The founder of the
Chola dynasty was Vijayalaya  (9th century AD)  but the real architects of the glory of
the dynasty were Rajaraja I (AD 985–AD 1014) and his son Rajendra I
(AD 1014–AD 1044). During  the heyday of the Chola empire, it extended from
R.Tungabhadra (a tributary of R.Krishna) in north to Kanya Kumari in south. The
Chola Kings made a successful use of their navy and conquered not only Maldive and
Lakshdweep  Islands but also Sri Lanka. They also defeated the kings of Malaya and
Java and Sumatra. One of the greatest contribution of Rajaraja I was the construction
of the famous temple known as Rajarajeshwara or Brihadesvara temple, dedicated to
Shiva at Tanjore. He also ordered a survey of land for better collection of land rev-
enue in his empire. The rule of his son, Rajendra I was even more dazzling. He
carried his arms up to Ganga in Bengal after defeating  the Pala King, Mahipala. To
commemorate this victory he founded a new capital called ‘Gangaikondacholapuram’
and acquired for himself the title “Gangai-konda” (conqueror of Ganga). He was a
great patron of learning  and was known as Pandita-chola. The last important Chola
king was Kullotunga (AD 1070–1122 AD). Under him the Chola empire started dis-
integrating and shrunk to much smaller area.
The above account will make you understand that though there were frequent inter
regional clashes, cultural growth was also taking place side by side. In fact, the emer-"

8.2 NATURE OF STATE
The state structure in this period has often been described as “decentralized” political
system. What is ‘decentralized’ polity? It is a system in which there is of course a king as
the main authority at the top, but he shares his rule with other small chiefs called feudatories
or the samantas. You may wonder who these samantas were. Well  the term ‘Samanta’
basically refers to a king who has been defeated but his kingdom has been restored to him
but with the condition that he will continue to accept the over lordship of the conquering
king and also pay regular tribute to him in cash or kind. He may also be asked to help with
military assistance in times of need. As these chiefs enjoyed freedom of administra-
tion over their regions they were quite powerful. Surely you can guess that these
chiefs could always be a threat to the overlord, and no wonder whenever there was
a weak king at the top, they would assert their independence leading to the break up
of the empire. And precisely it was what happened during the last days of Pratihara
empire as mentioned above.
Another aspect the decentralized polity was characterized by the practice of making
land grants to Brahmanas and others. This practice  was initiated by the Satavahanas
kings in the Ist and 2 nd centuries AD, but after the Gupta period it had become a
normal practice all over the country. Now land grants came to made not only to
religious persons and institutions but to state officials as well.Why did it so happen? It
is suggested that one of the reasons for the increase in land grants during this period,
was the decline in trade and, therefore the shortage of coined  money to pay to the
officials and others for their services. The shortage of coined money in the post-
Gupta period is indicated by the absence of the presence of coins in the archeological
finds. The land granted to the donee (the receiver of grant) was tax free, i.e., the
donee did not pay any tax to the state and used the produce and income on it for his
personal benefit. The donee was also free from any interference by his king or his
officials in managing the land donoted to him. Thus , these donees converted the
lands granted to  them into independent islands of authority with no or little central
control.
In the Chola kingdom in South India,the structure of administration was slightly dif-
ferent. Here at the village level, a great amount of autonomy was enjoyed by the
local people. They looked after their administration with the help of self elected local
bodies. Two types of village assemblies are mentioned in the records. These were
known as Sabha and Ur. Sabha was the assembly in the villages which were inhab-
ited predominantly by the brahmanas, whereas Ur was in the non brahmanical settle-
ments. These assemblies looked after the local public works, tax collection, temple
management etc., with the help of the members elected through a procedure set  by
the villagers. It was a unique feature of the Chola administration as it represented a
harmonious balance between the central authority and the local self-government."

MODULE - 1

Notes
 India Between AD 750–1200
the number of castes. How did it happen? One of the reason for it was the inclusion of
newer groups into brahmanical society. It is suggested that as the number of land grants
increased, new areas were brought under cultivation. It made local tribal people leave
hunting as their main profession and take up  agriculture. They were then transformed
into peasants, and assimilated in society as sudras. The land grants in fact resulted in
movement and migration of Brahmanas to different internal areas where they were
able to introduce  and enforce their brahmanical social values. The land grants also led
to the increase in the number of Kayastha class. The Kayasthas were basically scribes
and they specialized in drafting and writing land grant documents. Naturally, with in-
crease in the number of land grants their importance also increased .
But the most important feature of this period was the rise of  a new class of people
called the Rajputs, such as Chahmanas, Paramaras, Pratiharas, Chandellas etc. Some
historians believe that they were the descendants of various groups of foreign invaders
such as Sakas, Kushanas, Hunas etc, who had been coming to India from northwest
during different times of history. These people gradually settled down in the region of
Rajasthan and, after intermingling with the Indian society, emerged  as a warrior class.
There are others who treat them as a part of the Kshatriya varna of the brahmanical
system.But today many scholars see a connection between the rise of Rajput class and
the extension of agriculture activities in Rajasthan. It is pointed out that with the spread
of land grants there was an increase in the number of agriculture settlements. As a
result, many local chiefs came to acquire enough financial and political power to set up
an independent authority. In order to acquire legitimacy and authencity to  their newly
acquired position in the eyes  of their subjects, they invited brahmanas from Gangetic
and other regions to perform for them royal rituals and ceremonies, and in return gave
them land and other things as fee,i.e dakshina. They also made brahmanas write about
their illustrious ancestory linking them with lord Rama (of the solar race) and lord
Krishna (of the lunar race) to claim a dignified position of a warrior class.
Economically, the first phase, i.e, AD 750–AD 1000, is believed to be one of decline. It is
evident from the absence of coins for exchange and the decayed condition of towns in
northern India. But in the second phase after AD 1000, we notice a revival of trade
activities. Not only do  we come across new gold coins, there are also numerous refer-
ences to trade goods and towns. What could be the reason for it? There seem to be two
main reasons for it. One, there was increase in agricultural activities on account of land
grants in fresh areas. It led to surplus production of goods for exchange. And second, the
Arab traders had emerged on the coastal areas of India as important players in interna-
tional sea trade. The Arabs had acquired a foothold in Sind in AD 712 and later, gradually,
they set up their settlements all along the sea from Arabia to China. These settlements
served as important channels for the sale and purchase of Indian goods, and thus helped
in the growth of Indian external trade. In south India, the Chola kings maintained close
commercial contact with southeast Asia (Malaya, Indonesia etc) and China.

8.4 CULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS
The new regional kingdoms led to the emergence of new regional cultural zones such as
Bengal and Orissa in the North Gujarat and Maharashtra in Central India  as well as
Andhra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu in the South. The various art forms, languages, litera-
ture, etc. that form an important part of our regional cultures today, took their  shape
around this period. Most of the languages such as Bengali, Assamese Oriya, Marathi, etc.
that are spoken in the northern, central and eastern parts of India are some examples. The
rich literature produced in these languages began to replace the earlier monopoly of San-
skrit literature. The literary works in the regional languages were often composed under
the patronage of the new regional rulers. A famous work composed in the regional lan-
guage around this time under the Cholas was the Tamil version of the Ramayana, com-
posed by Kamban. Similarly in Karnataka, Pampa who is regarded as one of the jewels of
Kanada literature composed Vikramarjuna-vijaya, known popularly as Pampa Bharat,
in Kannada. In Andhra region, Nanniah translated some portions of Mahabharata in Telugu.
It was later completed by poet Tikkanna in the thirteenth centrury.
However, Sanskrit still retained a position of importance among the elites as a language of
learning. Important works composed in Sanskrit around this period were the
kathasaritasagara a collection of stories, the Rajtarangini, a vivid account of the kings
of Kashmir composed by Kalhana and the Gita Govinda, a piece of devotional literature

composed on the theme of love between Radha and Krishna, by Jayadeva in Bengal
under the Pala kings.
Another activity that received royal patronage was that of temple –building. The
temples served as representative of the might and glory of the kings who had them
built. The loftier the temple, the greater was the might reflected. Indeed there was a
definite correlation. The construction of large temples and their regular maintenance
required the mobilization of huge amount of resources, both financial and human. This
could be possible only when the particular king was wealthy & powerful enough.
The three types of temple architecture which evolved during the period are known as
the Nagara, Dravida and Vesara (mixed) styles during this period. The characterstic
feature of the Nagara style of temples was the lofty tower or spire called the Shikhara.
Temples built in this style were spread over large parts of northern India, particularly
in Central India, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Orissa. However,even within the general
Nagara style, there were distinctive regional characteristics. Some of the outstanding
examples of this style, are the Lingaraja temple at Bhuvaneshwar, the Sun temple at
Konark and the Kandariya Mahadeva temple, built by the Chandella kings at Khajuraho.
The Dravida style of architecture is found in South India. It reached the height of its
glory under the rule of the Chola kings. Some of the important characteristics of this
style are the garbhagriha , the vimanas , the mandapa  and the gopurams . The
garbhagriha was the inner sanctum that housed the chief-deity to whom the temple
was dedicated. The vimanas were the various storeys built atop the garbhagriha. The
mandapa was a hall with numerous carved pillars, placed before the garbhagriha.
The gopurams were the lofty gates along the high walls that enclosed the entire
temple complex. An important example of this style is the Brihadishvara temple built
by Chola king Rajaraja at Tanjore. The Vesara temples represented a mixed style.
These were mostly built under the patronage of the Chalukyas and are found at
Pattadakal near Badami (Karnataka). There was also great improvement in the art of
making sculptures in this period An important contribution of Chola artists in this
respect was the bronze images of Nataraja. These images represent Siva in his cos-
mic dance and are unmatched in their rythem and balance.

1. What was the style of architecture followed in Northern India?
2. What is the most important contribution of Cholas to the art of Sculpture.
8.5 CONTACT  WITH  SOUTHEAST  ASIA
Indians were never such people to stay at home. They have been moving out from
ancient time to different parts of the world for trade and other activities. As far as the
Indian contact with Southeast Asia is concerned, it appears to be as old as fifth cen-
tury B.C. Jatakas the Buddhist texts belonging to this period refer to Indians visiting
Suvarnadvipa (island of gold), which is identified with Java. Such early contacts with
Southeast Asia are confirmed by the recent archeological finds of pearls and orna-
ments of agate and carnelian, the semi-precious stones of Indian origin,from the coastral
sites in Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, etc. These finds belong to as far back as first"

century BC. According to the Chinese traditions, the first kingdom in South east Asia was
founded at Funan (Cambodia) in the fourth century AD by a brahman known as Kaundinya
who had come from India and had married the local princess. However, Indian and South-
east Asian contacts became closer from 5th century AD onwards when inscriptions in
Sanskrit language start appearing in many areas. It reached its peak during AD 800–AD
1300 when many kings and dynasties with Indian names emerge all over Southeast Asia.
The Southeast contact was largely on account of trade. Southeast Asia is rich in
cardamom, sandal wood, camphor, cloves etc. which formed important items of trade
between India and the West. Initially, the Indian traders appear to have settled along
the coast, but gradually they shifted their network to the interior. Along with the trad-
ers came the priests particularly the Buddhist and brahmanas, to meet the ritual re-
quirements of the Indian settlers. It thus created a situation for the spread of Indian social
and cultural ideas in South east Asia. But it must be noted that Indian contact did not uproot
the local culture. It was rather a case of peaceful intermixing of Indian concepts with local
cultural features. Therefore, for example, while Sanskrit was accepted as a language of
court and religion in Southeast Asia the regional languages continued to be used side by
side , and we find many inscriptions in mixed Sanskrit and local language. Similarly, the
concept of varna was known to the south east Asians and brahmanas were respected in
society, but social divisions were not rigid as it was in India.
The most important empire which come to be founded in South east Asia in the
8th Century AD was the Shailendra empire. It comprised Java, Sumatra,Malay-
Pennisula and other parts of the Southeast Asian region. They were a leading naval
power and on account of their geographical position controlled the trade between
China and India as well as other countries in the west. The Shailendra kings were
followers of Buddhism and had close contact with the Indian rulers. One of the kings
of this empire, built a monastery at Nalanda in the ninth century, and at his request the
Pala king Devapala of Bengal granted five villages for its upkeep. Similarly in the
eleventh century another king was permitted by the Chola king Rajaraja I to build a
Buddhist monastery at Nagapattam on the Tamil Coast . The Shailendras also built a
beautiful temple dedicated to Buddha at Barabudur in Java. It is situated on the top of
a hillock and consists of nine gradually receding terraces.
Besides Buddhism, the worship of Hindu gods such as Vishnu and Siva was also quite
popular in southeast Asia. The temples dedicated to them have been found at various
places. They show distinct traces of Indian influence and inspiration. One of the most
famous temples, dedicated to Vishnu, is Angkorvat temple built in the 12th century by
Surya Varman II, the king of Kambuja (Cambodia). It is surrounded by a moat, filled with
water. It has a huge gopuram (gateway) and number of galleries, the walls of which are
decorated with sculptures based on themes drawn from Mahabharat and Ramayana.

history. It was marked by various political, social and cultural activities. Politically, the
period between AD 750–AD 1200 is early Medieval period with the rise of numerous
regional states. In North India Gurjara- Prathiharas, Palas in east & Rashtrakutes in
South India rose to power in early years (750–1000) while in later years (1000–1200)
Rajput states in North & Cholas in South fetched power from previous rulers.
The nature of state is a decentralized political system wherein the king at the top is
assisted by small chiefs or Samanthas. Land grants become very common to religious
people & to state officials in lieu of salary. Sabha (Brahaman predominant village), Ur
(non brahaminical settlements) were local administering authorities in South India.
It is a period of economic decline due to diminishing overseas trade. During this
period several tribes gave up hunting, start tilling lands, and subsequently included into
brah- manical society.
This period is of robust cultural development. Regional languages & Regional litera-
ture developed around this time.Nagara, Dravida & Vesara style of temple architec-
ture evolved during this period. Cultural contacts with South east Asia (Java, Sematra,
Malay, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia), though developed on settlting of
Indian traders on these regions.

Notes
The rulers who ruled substantial parts of the North India between AD1200 to AD1526
were termed as Sultans and the period of their rule as the Delhi Sultanate. These
rulers were of Turkish and Afghan origin. They established their rule in India after
defeating the Indian ruling dynasties which were mainly Rajputs in northern India.
The main ruler who was overthrown by the invading Turk Muhammad Ghori from
Delhi was Prithvi Raj Chauhan. These Sultans ruled for more than 300 years (from
around AD 1200 to AD 1526). The last of the Delhi Sultan, Ibrahim Lodi was de-
feated by the Mughals under the leadership of Babur in AD1526 who established the
Mughal Empire in India.
During this period of around three hundred years five different dynasties ruled Delhi.
These were the Mamluks (AD 1206–AD 1290) (popularly known as slave dynasty),
the Khaljis (AD 1290–AD 1320), the Tughlaqs (AD 1320–AD 1412), the Sayyids
(AD 1412–AD 1451) and the Lodis (AD 1451– AD 1526). All these dynasties are
collectively referred as the Delhi Sultanate.
In this lesson we will give you a detailed account of the process of conquest, expan-
sion and consolidation of Delhi Sultanate in India.

 Establishment and Expansion of the Delhi sultanate
9.1 ARAB INVASION OF INDIA
In the early 8th century Arabs invaded India from the North-West region. This Arab
invasion in AD 712 was led by Muhammad Bin Qasim a general of the Umayyad caliph-
ate. Invasion on India was part of the policy of Arab expansion during this period.
The rise of Islam in Arabia (see box) gave rise to a new political system. The process
of expansion which had started after the capture of Mecca by the prophet Muhammad
continued after his death.
Rise And Spread Of Islam
In the 7thCentury AD, a new religion named “ISLAM” was born in Arabia and in
a very short span it carved out an empire extending from North Africa to Iberian
Peninsula to Iran and India. Islam was founded and preached by Prophet
Muhammad (AD 570–632). This religion transformed the religious, political and
social life of not only the people of Arabia but also of many parts of the world.
Islam laid emphasis upon belief in one God and its holy book as the “QURAN”.
Muslims believe that the Quran is revealed by God to Prophet Muhammad. Quran
is respected as the supreme source of authority in Islam. Every Muslim was asked
to pray five times a day, to fast during the month of Ramzan, to distribute alms and
to make a pilgrimage, if possible, to Mecca. After the death of Prophet (AD 632)
the task of providing religious and political leadership to the Muslims passed on to
the Caliphs. (Caliph is derived from the Arabic word ‘Khalifa’ which means
‘deputy’. This is a title given to the rulers who succeeded Prophet Muhammad).
Between AD 632–661 there were four pious Caliphs, all close companions of the
Prophet. The Umayyad Caliphate (AD 661–750) succeeded the pious Caliphs.
Umayyad dynasty gave stability and prosperity to the Caliphate. Umayyad dy-
nasty was followed by the Abbasid Caliphate (AD 750–1258). During the time of
later Abbasids, the Caliphs began to loose political control and independent Muslim
Rulers (Sultans) emerged in several regions.
The Arab expansion was notable for the speed with which it was accomplished. Between
AD 633–637, Arab conquered West Asia, Jordan Syria, Iraq, Turkey and Persia. They
also conquered parts of North Africa and Southern Europe. Between AD 639–637, Egypt
was also conquered. By AD 712, the Arabs had entered Spain and were soon making
inroads into Southern France. By the 8th Century AD, the Arabs had acquired a core
position from Spain to India, connecting the trade of Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean.
During the early years of the 8 th Century, the Umayyads reached the height of their
power. They had created the largest ever-Mulsim state that existed. Arabs were also
attracted by the wealth of India. Arab merchants and sailors had brought back stories of
great wealth of India. However, the reason for the invasion of Sindh was to avenge the
plunder of Arab Ships by pirates of Debol. King Dahir refused to punish the pirates.
Hajjaj the governor of Iraq despatched an army under Muhammad Bin Qasim. He
arrived in Sind in AD 712, and besieged Debol which was situated on the sea coast.
After crossing the Indus he marched forward. At Rawar, Muhammad Bin Qasim at-
tacked Dahir who was defeated. Arabs killed a large number of fleeing soldiers. Dahir
was also caught and killed. Muhammad Bin Qasim now proceeded forward and within
a short span he conquered various important places in Sind including Brahmanabad."

HISTORY
 Establishment and Expansion of the Delhi sultanate
The economic life of Sind got disturbed as a result of campaigns of Qasim. A large number
of people and merchants had fled from Sind. He had conquered the major portion of Sind up
to the lower Punjab. His rule lasted only for two years. However many Arabs settled down
in Sind and established relations with the local population. The Arab influence continued for
a long period with pockets of Muslim influence established in various parts of Sind.
9.2 MAHMUD GHAZNI
In all Mahmud Ghazni invaded India 17 times during AD 1000–1026. Mahmud Ghazni
was Son of Sabuktigin, the founder of Ghazni dynasty & Turkish slave commander.
Mahmud Ghazni first encountered the Hindushai ruler, Jaipal in AD 1001. In the
years AD 1004–06 Mahmud Ghazni attacked the rulers of Multan. Soon Punjab also
passed into the hands of the Ghaznavids. Between AD 1014–1019, Mahmud en-
riched his treasury by looting the temples of Nagarkot, Thanesar, Mathura and Kanauj.
The attack against Nagarkot in AD 1008 has been described as his first great tri-
umph. In AD 1025, Mahmud embarked on the most ambitious Indian campaign, the
attack on the Somnath temple in Saurashtra. Mahmud captured the city after grim
struggle in which more than 50,000 defenders lost their lives. Mahmud left Somnath
after a fortnight when he came to know that the Gujarat king Bhima-I had completed
preparations to confront him. His attacks on India were an attempt to fulfil his ambi-
tion to make Ghazni the formidable power in the politics of Central Asia. Mahmud’s
raids into India were only to acquire the famous wealth of India. This wealth would
help him to consolidate his vast rule in Central Asia. He did not wish to establish an
empire in India. The Ghaznavids had their control on parts of Punjab and Sind which
continued till AD 1135. However his invasions exposed the weak defence of Indian
kingdoms. They also opened possibility of attacks in future by the Turks.
9.3 MUHAMMAD GHORI (SHAHABUDDIN MUHAMMAD)
In AD 1173 Shahabuddin Muhammad (AD 1173–1206) also called Muhammad of Ghor
ascended the throne of Ghazni. The Ghoris were not strong enough to meet the growing
power and strength of the Khwarizmi Empire; they realised that they could gain nothing in
Central Asia. This forced Ghori to turn towards India to fulfil his expansionist ambitions.
Muhammad Ghori was very much interested in establishing permanent empire in
India and not merely looting its wealth. His campaigns were well organised and
whenever he conquered any territory, he left a general behind to govern it in his
absence. His invasions resulted in the permanent establishment of the Turkish Sul-
tanate in the region lying north of the Vindhya Mountains.
Conquest of Punjab and Sind
Muhammad Ghori led his first expedition in AD 1175. He marched against Multan
and freed it from its ruler. In the same campaign he captured Uchch from the Bhatti
Rajputs. Three years later in AD 1178 he again marched to conquer Gujarat but the
Chalukya ruler of Gujarat, Ghima II defeated him at the battle of Anhilwara. But this
defeat did not discourage Muhammad Ghori. He realised the necessity of creating a
suitable base in Punjab before venturing on the further conquest of India.
He launched a campaign against the Ghaznavid possessions in Punjab. As a result
Peshawar was conquered in AD 1179–80 and Lahore in AD 1186. The fort of Sialkot
and Debol were captured next. Thus by AD 1190 having secured Multan, Sind and Punjab,
Muhammad Ghori had paved the way for a further thrust into the Gangetic Doab."

The First Battle of Tarain (AD 1191)
Muhammad Ghori’s possession of Punjab and his attempt to advance into the Gangetic
Doab brought him into direct conflict with the Rajput ruler Prithivaraja Chauhan. He
had overrun many small states in Rajputana, captured Delhi and wanted to extend his
control over Punjab and Ganga valley. The conflict started with claims of Bhatinda.
In the first battle fought at Tarain in AD 1191, Ghori’s army was routed and he
narrowly escaped death. Prithviraj conquered Bhatinda but he made no efforts to
garrison it effectively. This gave Ghori an opportunity to re-assemble his forces and
make preparations for another advance into India.
The Second Battle of Tarain (AD 1192)
This battle is regarded as one of the turning points in Indian History. Muhammad Ghori
made very careful preparations for this conquest. The Turkish and Rajput forces again
came face to face at Tarain. The Indian forces were more in number but Turkish
forces were well organised with swift moving cavalry. The bulky Indian forces were
no match against the superior organisation, skill and speed of the Turkish cavalry. The
Turkish cavalry was using two superior techniques. The first was the horse shoe which
gave their horses a long life and protected their hooves. The second was, the use of
iron stirrup which gave a good hold to the horse rider and a better striking power in the
battle. A large number of Indian soldiers were killed. Prithviraj tried to escape but was
captured near Sarsuti. The Turkish army captured the fortresses of Hansi, Sarsuti and
Samana. Then they moved forward running over Delhi and Ajmer.
After Tarain, Ghori returned to Ghazni, leaving the affairs of India in the hand of his
trusted slave general Qutbuddin Aibak. In AD 1194 Muhammad Ghori again returned
to India. He crossed Yamuna with 50,000 cavalry and moved towards Kanauj. He
gave a crushing defeat to Jai Chand at Chandwar near Kanauj. Thus the battle of
Tarain and Chandwar laid the foundations of Turkish rule in Northern India.
The political achievements of Muhammad Ghori in India were long lasting than those
of Mahmud of Ghazni. While Mahmud Ghazni was mainly interested in plundering
Muhammad Ghori wanted to establish his political control. His death in AD 1206 did
not mean the withdrawal of the Turkish interests in India. He left behind his slave
General Qutbuddin Aibak who became first Sultan of the Delhi Sultanate.

 Establishment and Expansion of the Delhi sultanate
9.4 THE MAMLUK SULTANS
With Qutbuddin Aibak, begins the period of Mamluk Sultans or the slave dynasty.
Mamluk is an Arabic word meaning “owned”. It was used to distinguish the imported
Turkish slaves meant for military service from the lower slaves used as domestic
labour or artisan. The Mamluk Sultans ruled from AD 1206 to 1290.
Qutbuddin Aibak (AD 1206–1210)
Qutbuddin Aibak was a Turkish slave who had risen to high rank in Muhammad
Ghori’s army. After Muhammad Ghori’s death in AD 1206, the control of his
Indian possessions was passed on to Qutbuddin Aibak. Aibak was the first inde-
pendent Muslim ruler of Northern India, the founder of Delhi Sultanate.
Aibak had to face many revolts from Rajputs and other Indian chiefs. Tajuddin
Yaldauz, the ruler of Ghazni, claimed his rule over Delhi. Nasiruddin Qabacha,
the governor of Multan and Uchch aspired for independence. Aibak was able to
win over his enemies by conciliatory measures as well as a display of power. He
defeated Yaldauz and occupied Ghazni. The successor of Jaichand, Harishchandra
had driven out the Turks from Badayun and Farukhabad. Aibak re-conquered
both Badayun and Farukhabad.
Qutbuddin Aibak was brave, faithful and generous. Due to his generosity he was
known as “Lakh Baksh”. Most of the scholars consider Aibak as the real founder
of Mulsim rule in India.
Iltutmish (AD 1210–1236)
In AD 1210, Aibak died of injuries received in a fall from his horse while playing chaugan
(Polo). After his death a few amirs raised his son Aram Shah to the throne in Lahore.
But Aram Shah was incapable ruler and the Turkish amirs opposed him. The Turkish
chiefs of Delhi invited the governor of Badayun (son-in-law of Qutbuddin Aibak)
“Iltutmish” to come to Delhi. Aram Shah proceeded against him at the head of the army
from Lahore to Delhi but Iltutmish defeated him and became the Sultan with the name
of Shamsuddin. The credit of consolidating the Delhi Sultanate lies largely with him.
When Iltutmish ascended the throne, he found himself surrounded with many prob-
lems. Other commanders of Muhammad Ghori like Yaldauz, Qubacha and Ali Mardan
rose in defiance again. The chief of Jalor and Ranthambore joined Gwalior and Kalinjar
in declaring their independence. Apart from this, the rising power of Mongols under
Chenghiz Khan threatened the North West Frontier of the Sultanate.
Iltutmish took up the task of consolidating his position. He defeated Yaldauz in AD 1215
in the battle of Tarain. In AD 1217 he drove away Qabacha from Punjab. In AD 1220,
when Chenghiz Khan destroyed the Khwarizm expire, Iltutmish realised the political
necessity of avoiding a confrontation with the Mongols. Thus when Jalaluddin
Mangbarani, the son of the Shah of Khwarizm, while escaping from the Mongols,
sought shelter at Iltutmish’s court, Iltutmish turned him away. He thus saved the Sultan-
ate from destruction by the Mongols.
From AD 1225 onwards, Iltutmish engaged his armies in suppressing the disturbances
in the East. In AD 1226–27 Iltutmish sent a large army under his son Nasiruddin Mahmud
which defeated Iwaz Khan and brought Bengal and Bihar back into the Delhi Sultan-
ate. Similarly a campaign was also launched against the Rajput chiefs. Ranthambore
was captured in AD 1226 and by AD 1231 Iltutmish had established his authority over
Mandor, Jalore, Bayana and Gwalior."

 Establishment and Expansion of the Delhi sultanate
There is no doubt that Iltutmish completed the unfinished work of Aibak. The Delhi Sul-
tanate now covered a sizeable territory. Besides this, he also organised his trusted nobles
or officers into a group of “Forty” (Turkan-i-Chahalgani). He was a farsighted ruler
and he consolidated and organised the newly formed Turkish Sultanate in Delhi.
Iltutmish established ‘Group of Forty’ (Turkan-i-Chahalgani). These were Turkish
amirs (nobles) who advised and helped the Sultan in administering the Sultanate.
After the death of Iltutmish, this group assumed great power in its hands. For a
few years they decided on the selection of Sultans one after the other. The group
was finally eliminated by Balban.
Iltutmish effectively suppressed the defiant amirs of Delhi. He separated the Delhi
Sultanate from Ghazni, Ghor and Central Asian politics. Iltutmish also obtained a ‘Let-
ter of Investiture’ in AD 1229 from the Abbasid Caliph of Baghdad to gain legitimacy.
Iltutmish made a significant contribution in giving shape to administrative institution
such as iqtas, army and currency system. He gave the Sultanate two of its basic
coins– the silver ‘Tanka’ and the copper ‘Jittal’. To affect greater control over the
conquered areas Iltutmish granted iqtas (land assignments in lieu of cash salaries) to
his Turkish officers on a large scale. The recipients of “iqtas” called the “iqtadars”
collected the land revenue from the territories under them. Out of this they main-
tained an armed contingent for the service of the state, enforced law and order and
met their own expenses. Iltutmish realized the economic potentiality of the Doab and
the iqtas were distributed mainly in this region. This secured for Iltutmish the finan-
cial and administrative control over one of the most prestigious regions of North
India. (You will read details of administration in lesson 12)
Raziya  (AD 1236–40)
The problem of successor troubled Iltutmish during his last days. Iltutmish did not
consider any of his sons worthy of the throne. His own choice was his daughter
Raziya hence he nominated her as his successor. But after his death his son Ruknuddin
Firoz ascended the throne with the help of army leaders. However with the support
of the people of Delhi and some military leaders, Raziya soon ascended the throne.
Despite her obvious qualities, Raziya did not fare significantly better primarily be-
cause of her attempts to create a counter nobility of non-Turks and invited the wrath
of the Turkish amirs. They were particularly incensed over her decision to appoint the
Abyssinian, Malik Jamaluddin Yaqut, as the amir-i-akhur (master of the horses); the
recruitment of a few other non-Turks to important posts further inflamed matters.
The nobility realized that, though a woman, Raziya was not willing to be a puppet in
their hands, therefore the nobles started revolting against her in the provinces. They
accused her of violating feminine modesty and being too friendly to an Abbyssinian
noble, Yaqut. She got killed after she was defeated by the nobles. Thus her reign was
a brief one and came to end in AD 1240.
Nasiruddin Mahmud (1246–66 AD)
The struggle for power between Sultan and the Turkish Chiefs “Chahalgani” which
began during the reign of Raziya continued. After Raziya’s death, the power of
Chahalgani increased and they became largely responsible for making and unmak-
ing of kings. Behram Shah (AD 1240–42) and Masud Shah (AD 1242–46) were
made Sultans and removed in succession. After them, in AD 1246, Ulugh Khan (later"

HISTORY

known as Balban) placed the inexperienced and young Nasiruddin (grandson of
Iltutmish) on throne and himself assumed the position of Naib (deputy). To further
strengthen his position, he married his daughter to Nasiruddin. Sultan Nasiruddin
Mahmud died in AD 1265. According to Ibn Battuta and Isami, Balban poisoned his
master Nasiruddin and ascended the throne.
Balban (AD 1266–87)
The struggle between the sultan and the Turkish nobles continued, till one of the Turkish
chiefs, Ulugh Khan, known in history by the name of Balban, gradually arrogated all
power to himself and finally ascended the throne in AD 1266. When Balban became
the Sultan, his position was not secure. Many Turkish chiefs were hostile to him; the
Mongols were looking forward for an opportunity for attacking the Sultanate, the
governors of the distant provinces were also trying to become independent rulers, the
Indian rulers were also ready to revolt at the smallest opportunity.
The law and order situation in the area around Delhi and in the Doab region had deterio-
rated. In the Ganga-Yamuna doab and Awadh, the roads were infested with the robbers
and dacoits, because of which the communication with the eastern areas had become
difficult. Some of the Rajput zamindars had set up forts in the area, and defied the govern-
ment. The Mewatis had become so bold as to plunder people up to the outskirts of Delhi.
To deal with these elements, Balban adopted a stern policy. In the Mewat many were
killed. In the area around Badayun, Rajput strongholds were destroyed.
Balban ruled in an autocratic manner and worked hard to elevate the position of the
Sultan. He did not allow any noble to assume great power. He even formulated the theory
of kingship. The historian Barani, who was himself a great champion of the Turkish
nobles, says that Balban remarked ‘whenever I see a base born ignoble man, my eyes
burn and I reach in anger for my sword (to kill him).” We do not know if Balban actually
said these words but his attitude towards the non-Turks was that of contempt. Balban
was not prepared to share power with anyone, not even with his own family.
Balban was determined to break the power of the Chahalgani. To keep himself well
informed, Balban appointed spies in every department. He also organised a strong
centralized army, both to deal with internal disturbances, and to repel the Mongols who
had entrenched themselves in the Punjab and posed a serious threat to the Delhi Sultan-
ate. Balban re-organised the military department (diwan-i-arz) and deployed army in
different parts of the country to put down rebellion. The disturbances in Mewat, Doab,
Awadh and Katihar were ruthlessly suppressed. Balban also secured control over Ajmer
and Nagaur in eastern Rajputana but his attempts to capture Ranthambore and Gwalior
failed. In AD 1279, encouraged by the Mongol threats and the old age of Sultan the
governor of Bengal, Tughril Beg, revolted, assumed the title of Sultan and had the
khutba read in his name. Balban sent his forces to Bengal and had Tughril killed.
Subsequently he appointed his own son Bughra Khan as the governor of Bengal.
By all these harsh methods, Balban controlled the situation. In order to impress the
people with the strength and awe of his government, Balban maintained a magnifi-
cent court. He refused to laugh and joke in the court, and even gave up drinking wine
so that no one may see him in a non-serious mood. He also insisted on the ceremony
of sijada (prostration) and paibos (kissing of the monarch’s feet) in the court.
Balban was undoubtedly one of the main architects of the Sultanate of Delhi, particularly
of its form of government and institutions. By asserting the power of the monarchy,
Balban strengthened the Delhi Sultanate. But even he could not fully defend northern"

 Establishment and Expansion of the Delhi sultanate
India against the attacks of the Mongols. Moreover, by excluding non-Turkish from
positions of power and authority and by trusting only a very narrow racial group he made
many people dissatisfied. This led to fresh disturbances and troubles after his death.
Balban adopted a policy of consolidation rather than expansion.  He introduced a
new theory of kingship and redefined the relations between the Sultan and nobility.
Through these measures Balban strengthened the Delhi Sultanate.
Balban died in AD 1287. After his death the nobles raised his grandson Kaiquabad to
the throne. He was soon replaced by his son, Kaimurs, who remained on the throne
for a little over three months. During Balban’s reign, Firoz had been the warden of the
marches in north-west and had fought many successful battles against the Mongols.
He was called to Delhi as Ariz-i-Mumalik (Minister of War). In AD 1290 Firoz took
a bold step by murdering Kaimurs and seized the throne. A group of Khalji nobles led
by him established the Khalji dynasty. Some scholars call this event as the ‘dynastic
revolution’ of AD 1290. It brought to an end the so called slave dynasty and Firoz
ascended the throne under the title of Jalaluddin Khalji.

Jalaluddin Khalji (AD 1290–1296)
Jalaluddin Khalji laid the foundation of the Khalji dynasty. He ascended the throne at
the age of 70 years. Although Jalaluddin retained the earlier nobility in his administra-
tion, but the rise of Khaljis to power ended the monopoly of nobility of slaves to high
offices. Jalaluddin ruled only for a short span of six years. He tried to mitigate some
of the harsh aspects of Balban’s rule. He was the first ruler of the Delhi Sultanate to
clearly put forward the view that the state should be based on the willing support of
the governed, and that since the large majority of the people in India were Hindus, the
state in India could not be a truly Islamic state.
Jalaluddin tried to win the goodwill of the nobility by a policy of tolerance. He avoided
harsh punishments, even to those who revolted against him. He not only forgave them
but at times even rewarded them to win their support. However many people includ-
ing his supporters, considered him to be a weak sultan.
Jalaluddin’s policy was reversed by Alauddin Khalji who awarded drastic punish-
ments to all those who dared to oppose him."

Alauddin Khalji (AD 1296–1316)
Alauddin Khalji was Jalaluddin’s ambitious nephew and son-in-law. He had helped
his uncle in his struggle for power and was appointed as Amir-i-Tuzuk (Master of
Ceremonies). Alauddin had two victorious expeditions during the reign of Jalaluddin.
After the first expedition of Bhilsa (Vidisa) in AD 1292, he was given the iqta of
Awadh, in addition to that of Kara. He was also appointed Arizi-i-Mumalik (Minis-
ter of War). In AD 1294, he led the first Turkish expedition to southern India and
plundered Devagiri. The successful expedition proved that Alauddin was an able
military commander and efficient organiser. In July AD 1296, he murdered his uncle
and father-in-law Jalaluddin Khalji and crowned himself as the Sultan.
Alauddin decided to revive Balban’s policies of ruthless governance. He decided to
curb the powers of the nobles and interference of Ulema in the matters of the state.
He also faced, a few rebellions in succession during the early years of his rule.
According to Barani, the author of Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi, Alauddin felt that there
were four reasons for these rebellions: 1) The inefficiency of the spy system, 2) the
general practice of the use of wine, 3) Social intercourse among the nobles and inter
marriage between them and 4) the excess of wealth in the possession of certain nobles.
In order to prevent the reoccurrence of these rebellions, Alauddin formulated certain
regulations and implemented them. (1) Families that had been enjoying free land to sup-
port themselves should pay land tax for their holdings. This curbed the excess of wealth
owned by some people. (2) The Sultan reorganized the spy system and took measure to
make it more effective. (3) The use of liquor and intoxicants was prohibited. (4) The nobles
were ordered not to have social gatherings or inter-marriages without his permission.
Alauddin established a huge permanent, standing army to satisfy his ambition of con-
quest and to protect the country from Mongol invasion.
Market Regulations of Alauddin Khalji
Alauddin’s measures to control the markets were one of the most important policy
initiative. Since Alauddin wanted to maintain a large army, he therefore, lowered
and fixed the price of the commodities of daily use.  To control the prices, Alauddin
set up three different markets for different commodities in Delhi.  These markets
were the grain market ( Mandi), cloth market (Sarai Adl)  and the market for
horses, slaves, cattles, etc.  To ensure implementation, Alauddin appointed a super-
intendent (Shahna-i-Mandi) who was assisted by an intelligence officer. Apart
from Shahna-i-Mandi, Alauddin received daily reports of the market from two
other independent sources, barid (intelligence officer) and munhiyans (secret
spies). Any violation of Sultan’s orders resulted in harsh punishment, including ex-
pulsion from the capital, imposition of fine, imprisonment and mutilation.
Control of prices of horses was very important for the Sultan because without the
supply of good horses at reasonable price to army, the efficiency of the army could
not be ensured.  Low price in the horse market were ensured by putting a stop to
the purchase of horses by horse dealers and brokers (dalals) in Delhi market.
Expansion of Delhi Sultanate
Under Alauddin Khalji the territorial expansion of the Delhi Sultanate, beyond North
India, was the most important achievement."

 Establishment and Expansion of the Delhi sultanate
Alauddin first began his territorial conquest with a campaign against Gujarat. Alauddin was
motivated by his desire to establish a vast empire and obtain the wealth of Gujarat. The
riches of Gujarat were to pay for his future conquests and her sea port was to ensure a
regular supply of Arab horses for his army. In AD 1299, an army under two of Alauddin’s
noted generals Ulugh Khan and Nusarat Khan marched against Gujarat. Rai Karan the ruler
of Gujarat fled, the temple of Somnath was captured. An enormous booty was collected.
Even the wealthy Muslim merchants were not spared. Many slaves were captured. Malik
Kafur was one among them who later became the trusted commander of the Khalji forces
and led the invasions to South India. Gujarat now passed under the control of Delhi.
After the annexation of Gujarat, Alauddin turned his attention towards Rajasthan. Ranthambore
was the first target. Ranthambore was reputed to be the strongest fort of Rajasthan and had
earlier defied Jalaluddin Khalji. The capture of Ranthambore was necessary to break the
power and morale of the Rajputs. The immediate cause of attack was that the ruler of
Ranthambore Hamirdeva gave shelter to two rebellious Mongol soldiers and refused to hand
over them to the Khalji ruler. Hence an offensive was launched against Ranthambore. To
begin with the Khalji forces suffered losses. Nusrat Khan even lost his life. Finally Alauddin
himself had to come on the battle filed. In AD 1301, the fort fell to Alauddin.
In AD 1303, Alauddin besieged Chittor, another powerful state of Rajputana. According to
some scholars, Alauddin attacked Chittor because he coveted Padmini, the beautiful
queen of Raja Ratan Singh. However many scholars do not agree with this legend as
this is first mentioned by Jaisi in his Padmavat more than two hundred years later.
According to Amir Khusrau, the Sultan ordered a general massacre of the civil popula-
tion. Chittor was renamed Khizrabad after the name of Sultan’s son Khizr Khan. Alauddin
however returned back quickly to Delhi as Mongol army was advancing towards Delhi.
In AD 1305, Khalji army under Ain-ul-Mulk captured Malwa. Other states such
as Ujjain, Mandu, Dhar and Chanderi were also captured. After the conquest of
Malwa, Alauddin sent Malik Kafur to the South and himself attacked Siwana.
The ruler of Siwana Raja Shital Deva defended the fort bravely but was ulti-
mately defeated. In AD 1311, another Rajput kingdom Jalor was also captured.
Thus by AD 1311, Alauddin had completed the conquest of large parts of Rajputana
and became the master of North India.
Deccan and South India
The imperialist ambitions of Alauddin were not satisfied with the conquest of the
north. He was determined to conquer south as well. The wealth of the southern
kingdoms attracted him. The expeditions to the south were sent under Malik Kafur, a
trusted commander of Alauddin who held the office of the Naib.
In AD 1306–07, Alauddin planned fresh campaign in Deccan. His first target was Rai Karan
(the earlier rule of Gujarat), who had now occupied Baglana, and defeated him. The second
expedition was against Rai Ramachandra, the ruler of Deogir who had earlier promised to pay
tribute to Sultan but did not pay. Ramachandra surrendered after little resistance to Malik Kafur
and was treated honourably. He was kept a guest at Alauddin’s court and was given a gift of
one lakh tankas and the title of Rai Rayan. He was also given a district of Gujarat and one of his
daughters was married to Alauddin. Alauddin showed generosity towards Ramachandra be-
cause he wanted to have Ramachandra as an ally for campaigns in the South.
After AD 1309 Malik Kafur was despatched to launch campaign in South India. The
first expedition was against Pratab Rudradeva of Warangal in the Telengana area.
This siege lasted for many months and came to an end when Rai agreed to part with
his treasures and pay tribute to Sultan."

The second campaign was against Dwar Samudra and Ma’bar (modern Karnataka
and Tamil Nadu). The ruler of Dwar Samudra, Vir Ballala III realized that defeating
Malik Kafur would not be an easy task, hence he agreed to pay tribute to Sultan
without any resistance. In the case of Ma’bar (Pandya Kingdom) a direct decisive
battle could not take place. However, Kafur plundered as much as he could including a
number of wealthy temples such as that of Chidambaram. According to Amir Khusrau,
Kafur returned with 512 elephants, 7000 horses, and 500 mans of precious stone. The
Sultan honoured Malik Kafur by appointing him Naib Malik of the empire. Alauddin’s
forces under Malik Kafur continued to maintain a control over the Deccan kingdoms.

Following the death of Alauddin in AD 1316, the Delhi Sultanate was plunged into confu-
sion. Malik Kafur sat on the throne for a few days, only to be deposed by Qutbuddin
Mubarak Shah. During this period, rebellions broke out in Deogir but were harshly sup-
pressed. Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah was soon murdered and Khusrau ascended the throne.
However he too did not last long as some dissatisfied officers, led by Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq,
defeated and killed him in a battle. Thus only four years after the death of Alauddin, the
Khalji dynasty came to end and power passed into the hands of the Tughlaqs.
9.6 THE TUGHLAQS (AD 1320–1412)
The founder of the Tughlaq dynasty was Ghazi Malik who ascended the throne as
Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq in AD 1320 and this dynasty ruled till AD 1412. Giyasuddin rose
to an important position in the reign of Alauddin Khalji. After a brief rule Ghiyassuddin
Tughlaq died in AD 1325 and his son Muhammad Tughlaq ascended the throne.
Under the Tughlaqs the Delhi Sultanate was further consolidated. Many outlying
territories were brought under the direct control of the Sultanate.
The Deccan and South
The regions of the Deccan which were conquered by the Khaljis had stopped paying
tribute and were proclaiming independent status. Muhammad Tughlaq while a prince
(called Juna Khan) led the early expeditions against Rai Rudra Dev who was de-
feated after a prolonged conflict and Warangal was now annexed under direct con-
trol of the Sultanate. Ma’bar was also defeated. Now the whole region of Telangana
was divided into administrative units and made part of the Sultanate. In contrast to
Allauddin Khalji’s policy the Tughlaqs annexed the Deccan region. Muhammad Tughlaq
even decided to transfer his capital from Delhi to Deogir and renamed it as Daultabad.
In fact he wanted to control the northern region from this place. Substantial number of
nobles, religious men and craftsmen shifted to the new capital. It seems that the idea
was to treat it as the second capital and not abandon Delhi. Later the whole scheme
was given up. However, the plan improved ties between the north and south. Apart
from territorial expansion the social, cultural and economic interactions also grew.
East India
Bhanudeva II, the ruler of Jajnagar in Orissa had helped Rai Rudra Dev of Warangal in his
battle against Delhi Sultans. Ulug Khan led an army against him in AD 1324 Bhanudeva II
was defeated and his territory annexed. In Bengal there was discontent of nobles against
their Sultan. The dissatisfied nobles invited the Tughlaq prince to invade their ruler. The
army of Bengal was defeated and a noble Nasiruddin was installed on the throne.
North West
The Mongol invasions from the North-West region were rocking the Sultanate on regu-
lar intervals. In AD 1326–27 a big Mongol assault under Tarmashirin Khan took place."

HISTORY
 Establishment and Expansion of the Delhi sultanate
Transfer of Capital
One of the controversial measures of Muhammad bin Tughlaq was that he transferred
his capital from Delhi to Deogir (Daultabad). According to Dr. Mahdi Hussain, the
Sultan wanted to maintain both Delhi and Daultabad as his capitals. As per Barani, in
AD 1326–27, Sultan decided to shift his capital from Delhi to Deogir (Daultabad) in the
Deccan because it was more centrally located. According to Ibn Batuta, the people of
Delhi used to write letters containing abuses to the Sultan, therefore, in order to punish
them Sultan decided to shift the capital. Isami say that it was a place at a safer distance
from the North West frontier and thus-safe from the Mongols. In view of different
versions it is difficult to assign one definite reason for this shift.
The entire population was not asked to leave only the upper classes consisting of
shaikhs, nobles, ulema were shifted to Daultabad. No. attempt was made to
shift the rest of the population. Though Muhammad bin Tughlaq built a road from
Delhi to Deogir and set up rest houses but the journey was extremely harsh for the
people. Large number of people died because of rigorous travelling and the heat.
Due to growing discontent and the fact that north could not be controlled from
south, Muhammad decided to abandon Daultabad.
Muhammad Tughlaq decided to secure the frontier. The region from Lahore to Kalanur
including Peshawar was conquered and new administrative control was established.
Besides, the Sultan also planned invasions of Qarachil region (In present day Himachal)
and Qandhar but did not succeed. In fact these schemes resulted in heavy loss.
Muhammad Tughlaq was very innovative in adopting new policies. He started a new
department for the development of Agriculture. It was called Diwan-i Kohi. Peas-
ants were given financial support to help in arranging seeds for cultivation. This loan
was also given in case of crop failures. Another important measure was to introduce
token currency to tide over the shortage of Silver. However, this scheme failed
causing great financial loss to the sultanate.
Token Currency
Another controversial project undertaken by Muhammad bin Tughlaq was the in-
troduction of “Token Currency”. According to Barani, the Sultan introduced token
currency because the treasury was empty due to the Sultan’s schemes of conquest
as well as his boundless generosity. Some historians are of the opinion that there
was a shortage of silver world wide at that time and India too faced the crisis
therefore, the Sultan was forced to issue copper coins in place of silver.
Muhammad introduced a copper coin (Jittal) in place of silver coin (tanka) and ordered
that it should be accepted as equivalent to the tanka. However, the idea of token cur-
rency was new in India and it was difficult for traders and common people to accept it.
The State also did not take proper precautions to check the imitation of coins issued by
the mints. Government could not prevent people from forging the new coins and soon
the new coins flooded the markets. According to Barani the people began to mint token
currency in their houses. However the common man failed to distinguish between
copper coin issued by the royal treasury and those which were locally made. Thus the
Sultan was forced to withdraw the token currency.
Muhammad Tughlaq was succeeded by his cousin Firuz Tughlaq. Under him no new
territories could be added to the Sultanate. He managed to keep large areas intact"

with great efforts. However, the political control of Delhi gradually weakened during
the rule of Firuz’s successors. The invasion of Timur in AD 1398 left the sultanate
desolate. By the end of Tughlaq rule (AD 1412) the Sultanate was confined to a small
territory in north India. A number of regions proclaimed independent status. In the
east Bengal and Orissa enjoyed complete autonomy. In eastern UP and large parts of
Bihar a new independent kingdom of Sharqis emerged. In the Deccan and South
Vijaynagar empire and Bahmani kingdom became political powers. Large parts of
Punjab were occupied by independent nobles. Gujarat and Malwa became fully inde-
pendent. Rajput states in Rajasthan no longer treated Delhi Sultans as their overlords.

9. 7 SAYYID DYNASTY (1414–1450 AD)
After defeating the army of Delhi in 1398 Timur appointed Khizr Khan as the ruler of
Multan. Khizr Khan defeated Sultan Daulat Khan and occupied Delhi and founded
Sayyid dynasty. He did not assume the title of Sultan but was comfortable with Rayat-
i-Ala. The author of the Tarikh-i-Mubarak Shahi, Yahya Sirhindi claims that the founder
of the Sayyid dynasty was a descendant of the prophet.
Khizr Khan was the most competent Sayyid rule of the dynasty. After Khizr Khan’s
death Mubarak Shah (AD 1412–34) and Muhammad Shah (AD 1434–45) ascended
the throne one after another. All of these rulers tried to control rebellious regions like
Katehar, Badaun, Etawah, Patiali, Gwalior, Kampil, Nagaur and Mewat but they failed
due to the conspiracy of the nobles.
In 1445 AD, Alam Shah ascended the throne and became the Sultan. He proved a
totally incompetent Sultan. Alam Shah’s Wazir Hamid Khan invited Bhalol Lodi to
take charge of the army and after realizing that it would be difficult to continue as
Sultan, Alam Shah left for Badaun.
9.8 RECONSOLIDATION UNDER LODI DYNASTY (1451–1526)
With the help of a few nobles Bahlol Lodi (AD 1451–1489) took charge of the army,
and became the Sultan. Thus he laid the foundation of Lodi dynasty whose rulers
were Afghans. The Lodis were the last ruling family of the Sultanate period and the
first to be headed by the Afghans.
Sultan Bahlol Lodi was a capable general. He was aware of the fact that to establish
his control over Sultanate he would require help and support of Afghan nobles. The
Afghan nobles wanted Sultan to treat them as an equal partner rather than an abso-"

lute monarch. To placate them Bahlol publicly declared that he considered himself
one of the Afghan peers and not the king. He did not sit on the throne nor did he insist
on his nobles standing in his court. This policy worked well throughout his long reign
and he did not face any trouble from his powerful Afghan nobles.
Bahlol Lodi successfully suppressed the revolts in Mewat and Doab. In AD 1476 he
defeated the Sultan of Jaunpur and annexed it to Delhi Sultanate. He also brought the
ruler of Kalpi and Dholpur under the Suzerainty of Delhi. However, he failed to re-
occupy Bengal, Gujarat and the Deccan.
After the dealth of Bahlol Lodi, Sikandar Lodi (AD 1489–1517) ascended the throne. Sikandar
Lodi showed little tolerance towards the non-mulsims. He re-imposed jaziya on non-mulsims.
Sikandar Lodi believed in the superior position of the Sultan vis-a-vis the nobles. He
compelled nobles and amirs to show formal respect to the Sultan in darbar and
outside and treated them harshly. He re-annexed Bihar, Dholpur, Narwar and some
parts of the kingdom of Gwalior and Nagor to the Delhi Sultanate.
After the death of Sikandar Lodi in AD 1517 his nobles helped Ibrahim Lodi to become
Sultan. His reign proved a period of revolts. Firstly his own brother Jalal Khan rebelled.
Sultan Ibrahim Lodi got him murdered. Bihar declared its independence. Daulat Khan
the governor of Punjab also rebelled. Sultan’s behaviour caused much dissatisfaction.
The rebellions Daulat Khan sent an invitation to Babur at Kabul to invade India. Babur
defeated Sultan Ibrahim Lodi in AD 1526 in the battle at Panipat.
Summing up the end of the Sultanate, a scholar states “The Sultanate of Delhi, which
had its birth on the battlefield of Tarain in AD 1192, breathed its last in AD 1526 a few
miles away on the battlefield of Panipat”.

9.9 CHALLENGES FACED BY THE SULTANATE
With the establishment of the Mughal Empire the rule of Delhi sultanate came to an
end. During more than 300 years of its rule the Delhi sultanate went through various
ups and downs but survived as a political force. Here we would like to discuss the
major challenges the sultanate faced.
Attacks by Mongols and others
Since its inception the major threat to the sultanate came in the form of Mongol
invasions. Mongols were nomadic groups who inhabited the steppes north of China
and east of Lake Baikal. They formed a huge nomadic empire under Chengiz Khan"

in the 12 thcentury. From 13 th century onwards they repeatedly attacked the Delhi
Sultanate. The Sultans as a policy appeased them and also at times confronted. Balban
and Allauddin Khalji confronted them with full military might. During Khalji’s time
Mongols under Qultlug Khwaja even besieged Delhi and caused a lot of damage. The
last significant attack of Mongols was by Tarmashirin during the reign of Muhammad
Tughlaq. A lot of energy and resources of the Sultans were spent in facing these
invasions but they could not destroy the sultanate.
Another important attack which shook the foundation of the sultanate was by Timur in
1398. The weakness of the Delhi Sultanate was made even worse by Timur’s invasion of
Delhi (1398). Timur was a son of the Chief of Chagtai branch of Turks. When he invaded
India he was the master of almost whole of Central Asia. Timur’s raid into India was a
plundering raid and his motive was to seize the wealth accumulated by the Sultans of Delhi
over the last 200 years. Sultan Nasiruddin and his Wazir Mallu Iqbasl faced Timur but
were defeated. Timur entered Delhi and stayed for 15 days. He ordered general massa-
cre and large number of Hindu and Muslim including women and children were murdered.
Before leaving India Timur’s invasion indicated the downfall of Delhi Sultanate. Delhi
Sultanate lost control over Punjab. Timur appointed Khizr Khan, the ruler for Multan who
controlled Punjab also. After the fall of Tughlaq dynasty he occupied Delhi and became
the ruler of Delhi Sultanate. He laid the foundation of Saiyyid Dynasty.
Inner Conflict of Nobility
Three hundred years of Delhi Sultanate witnessed five dynasties ruling over it. The
main reason for change of dynasties and deposing of rulers was a constant struggle
between the Sultan and the nobility (Umara). Soon after the death of Aibak they
started fighting over the question of succession. Finally Iltutimish emerged victorious.
Iltutimish created a group of loyal nobles called Turkan-i-Chihiligani (‘The Forty’).
After the death of Iltutimish various factions of the group of forty got involved in
making their favourite son/daughter as the sultan. In ten years five sultans were
changed. After that the Sultan who occupied the throne (Nasiruddin Mahmud) for 20
years hardly ruled and one of the powerful noble Balban was defacto sultan. The
same Balban succeeded Nasiruddin after his death. Almost similar events happened
after the death of each powerful sultan (Balban, Alauddin Khalji, Firoz Tughlaq and
others.) Since there was no well defined law of succession each noble tried to either
crown himself or support some favourite heir of the dead sultan. Finally Afghans
replaced the Turks as sultan with the accession of Bahlol Lodi.
Provincial Kingdoms
Another consequence of this conflict was declaration of independence by various
provincial heads in the regions. As a result a number of independent Afghan and
Turkish kingdoms emerged. Important ones of such states were Bengal (Lakhnouti),
Jaunpur, Malwa, Gujarat, the Bahmani kingdom in the Deccan etc. Quite often these
states were at war with the Sultanate. The whole process weakened the sultanate.
Resistance by Indian Chiefs
The sultans had to face the resistance from Indian chiefs at regular intervals. The
Rajput chiefs in Rajputana (Mewar, Ranthambhor, Chittor etc.), Warangal, Deogiri &
Ma’bar in Deccan and South, the king of Dhar, Malwa in Central India, Jajnagar in
Orissa and a host of smaller chieftains were constantly at war even after successive
defeats. All these struggles weakened the sultanate."

HISTORY
 Establishment and Expansion of the Delhi sultanate
The Delhi sultanate was considerably weakened after the Khalji and Tughlaq reign.
Finally the invasion of Babur in AD 1526 brought it to an end. Now a much more
centralised and strong empire under the Mughals established itself in India and ruled
for a further period of more than two hundred years. We will discuss it in our next
lesson on the Mughal Rule. But before moving to the Mughals we provide you a brief
account of the provincial kingdoms.
Rise of The Provincial Kingdoms
You have read that the process of disintegration of the Delhi Sultanate had started
during the reign of Muhammad bin Tughlaq. However, Firuz Shah Tughlaq tried to
control the situation but failed. During this period, some of the provincial rulers de-
clared their independence from the rule of the Sultanate.
Jaunpur
Jaunpur was a prosperous province in the eastern part of Delhi Sultanate. Malik
Sarwar was the Governor of Jaunpur. Soon he became the ruler of Kanauj, Kara,
Awadh, Sandeela, Dalmau, Bahraich, Bihar and Tirhut. Though Malik Sarwar did not
assume the title of Sultan, but he laid down the foundation of Sharqi Dynasty.
After the death of Malik Sarwar in AD 1399, his adopted son Malik Karanphul
succeeded the throne. He assumed the title of Mubarak Shah and thus was the first
ruler of Sharqi dynasty. When Mubarak Shah was the ruler of Jaunpur dynasty,
during that time Mahmud Tughlaq, the Sultan of Delhi was the puppet in the hands
of Mallu Iqbal. Mallu Iqbal undertook an expedition to recover Jaunpur but failed.
On Mubarak Shah’s death in AD 1402 his younger brother Ibrahim ascended the
throne. He ruled for 34 years.
During Ibrahim’s reign the relations between Delhi and Jaunpur became worse. Ibrahim
was the greatest ruler of Sharqi dynasty under whom Jaunpur became an important centre
of learning. Under him Jaunpur evolved a distinct architecture which is known as Sharqi
style of architecture. The most famous of their buildings was the Atala Masjid at Jaunpur.
Ibrahim’s successor Mahmud conquered the fort of Chunar. He also tried to conquer
Kalpi but failed. He invaded Delhi but was defeated by Bahlol Lodi. After Mahmud,
Jaunpur saw the rule of Muhammad Shah and Husain Shah. Husain Shah died in
AD 1500 and with him ended the Sharqi dynasty.
Kashmir
Shamshuddin Shah (AD 1339) was the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir. In AD 1389
Sikandar ascended the throne. He was a powerful and despotic ruler. Sikandar died in
AD 1416 and his son Ali Shah ascended the throne. After some years his brother
Shah Khan ascended the throne under the title of Zainul Abidin.
Zainul Abidin was a liberal and enlightened ruler. To secure the support of all the
groups, he called back all such groups who had been banished by Sikandar. He abol-
ished ‘jaziya’ and prohibited cow slaughter. Zainul Abidin paid great attention to-
wards the economic growth of Kashmir. He himself was a great scholar of Persian,
Sanskrit, Tibetan and Kashmiri language. He ordered the translation of Mahabharata
and Rajatarangini (history of Kashmir) into Persian.
Zainul Abidin’s successor proved a weak ruler. Taking advantage of his weaknesses
Mirza Haider, a relative of Babur conquered Kashmir. In AD 1586 Kashmir was
annexed by Akbar and became part of the Mughal Empire."

Malwa
Malwa was the south-western province of Delhi Sultanate. It was conquered by Sultan
Alauddin in AD 1310 and remained the part of Delhi Sultanate till the death of Firuz Tughlaq.
Dilawar Khan threw off his allegiance to Delhi in AD 1401 after the invasion of Timur. He
did not take the royal title of Sultan. After the death of Dilawar Khan in AD 1405, his son Ala
Khan ascended the throne and acquired the title of Hoshang Shah. He made Mandu his
capital. The Hindi Mahal, Jama Masjid, Jahaz Mahal are examples of Mandu architecture.
Hoshang Shah was succeeded by Ghazi Khan who was deposed by his minister
Mahmud Khan Khalji in AD 1436. Mahmud assumed the title of Shah and laid the
foundation of Khalji dynasty of Malwa. Under Mahmud Khalji, Malwa became strong
and prosperous kingdom. He was a generous king. According to Ferishta he was
polite, brave and learned person. Mahmud Khalji was followed by Ghiyasuddin and
Nasiruddin. Mahmud II ascended the throne of Malwa in AD 1510. He called Medini
Rai, a powerful Rajput to crush his disloyal nobles and appointed him his prime minis-
ter. The predominance of Rajputs at the court created jealousy among the Muslims
nobles. The Sultan of Gujarat defeated Malwa and annexed Malwa to Gujarat.
Gujarat
Gujarat has always attracted the invaders due to its geographical location, pros-
perity and fertility. Sultan Alauddin Khalji was the first Sultan who annexed Gujarat
to the Delhi Sultanate. Since then it remained under the Turkish governors. At the
time of Timur’s invasion, Zafar Khan was the governor of this province. He
threw off the allegiance to Delhi Sultanate. In AD 1410, he became the indepen-
dent ruler of Gujarat. The most famous of the Gujarat rulers was Ahmad Shah
(AD 1411 to 1441). To extend his kingdom, he restrained the Rajput States. Ahmad
Shah founded the city of Ahmedabad.  After the death of Ahmed Shah in AD 1441
his eldest son Muhammad Shah ascended the throne. He was known as Zar-Baksh.
He was killed by conspirators in AD 1451. Muhammad Shah was followed by two
weak rulers. Nobles raised Fateh Khan, a grandson of Ahmad Shah to the throne. He
ruled as Mahmud. Mahmud was the ablest ruler of his dynasty. He ruled for 52 years.
Mahmud died in AD 1511. He was followed by a number of rulers who had brief
reigns. In AD 1572 Akbar conquered Gujarat and annexed it to the Mughal Empire.
Bengal
Bengal was the easternmost province of Delhi Sultanate. Lack of proper means of trans-
portation and communication created difficulty in controlling this province. Though Bengal
was annexed to the Delhi Sultanate, a number of times it gained its independence. During
the last decade of the 12th century AD Muhammad Bin Bakhitiyar annexed Bengal to
the conquered territories of Muhammad Ghori. But after his death, his successors de-
clared their independence with the support of the local people. Balban forced Bengal to
accept the sovereignty of Delhi and appointed his son Bughra Khan as its governor. But
after Balban’s death he declared his own independence. Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq tried to
solve this problem by partitioning Bengal into three independent administrative divisions
namely Lakhnauti, Satgaon and Sonargaon. Muhammad bin Tughlaq tried to declare
the supremacy of Delhi Sultanate but when he was busy in suppressing rebellion in
other parts of Sultanate Bengal cut off its connection with Delhi.
Haji Iliyas, a noble united Bengal and became its ruler under the title of Shamsh-ud-
din Iliyas Shah. To counter increasing influence of Haji Iliyas Firuz Shah Tughlaq
invaded Bengal but did not meet with success. He had to sign a treaty with Iliyas."

According to the treaty, river Kosi was accepted as the boundary line between two

During his reign Firuz Shah Tughlaq again tried to annex Bengal but failed. After the
death of Sikandar, Ghiyasuddin Azam ascended the throne. He maintained friendly
relations with the king of China which led to the rich foreign trade. This time, Nasiruddin,
a grandson of Haji Iliyas was the ruler of Bengal. He peacefully ruled for 17 years.
During the reign of Alauddin Husain Shah, Bengal became rich and prosperous. On his death in
AD 1518 his son Nasib Khan ascended the throne under the title of Nasir-ud-din Nusrat Shah.
In AD 1538 Sher Shah Suri defeated Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah and made Bengal a

WHAT YOU HA VE LEARNT
Islam rose in Arabia and spread quickly in different parts of the world under the
caliphs. The Arabian armies captured the large parts of central Asia and even at-
tacked India in 712 AD. The next important invasion into India was when Mahmud
Ghazni attacked India. His main intention was to carry the wealth of India to Ghazni.
In the 12th century India was divided into small kingdoms mostly ruled by Rajput
chiefs. During this time the political condition of central Asia was not good because of
which Muhammad Ghori was to look towards India for expansion. In AD 1191 (First
battle of Tarain) Muhammad Ghori was defeated by Prithviraj Chauhan. In 1192 (sec-
ond battle of Tarain) Muhammad Ghori returned and this time Rajput forces were de-
feated. Thus Delhi passed into the hands of Turks. Muhammad Ghori left his Indian
possessions in the hands of his trusted slave – general Qutbuddin Aibak which led to the
establishment of Delhi Sultanate. Iltutmish further consolidated the Sultanate by putting
down internal rebellions and conciliating the nobility by forming of ‘Group of Forty’. The
last powerful Sultan of slave dynasty was Balban who became the Sultan in AD 1266.
He ruled in an autocratic manner and worked hard to elevate the position of sultan.
After the death of Balban in AD 1287, the Khaljis came to the power in AD 1290.
The coming of Khaljis marked a break in the monopoly of Turkish rule. Jalaluddin
Khalji laid the foundation of Khalji dynasty. In AD 1296, Alauddin Khalji murdered his
uncle and father-in-law Jalaluddin Khalji and crowned himself as Sultan. He restored
the prestige of the crown. He suppressed the nobility and ruled as an autocrat. His
able general Alp Khan, Nusrat Khan, Zafar Khan, Ulugh Khan, Malik Kafur won him
many victories. Another important measure taken by Alauddin was the establishment"

of markets where good were sold at fixed prices and did not allow any trader to earn
more profit. He set up different markets for different commodities in Delhi.
The Khalji dynasty was followed by the Tughlaqs. Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq ascended the
throne in AD 1320. He was succeeded by Muhammad Tughlaq in AD 1325. Muhammad
Tughlaq is famous for his innovative projects. These projects included the transfer of his
capital from Delhi to Daultabad, and introduction of token currency. Following the death
of Muhammad Tughlaqs, the amirs and ulemas placed Firuz Tughlaq on the throne.
During his reign the forces of disintegration were active. In AD 1398 Timur invaded the
Delhi Sultanate in order to plunder it. The invasion of Timur gave an opportunity to the
provincial Kingdoms to declare their independence from the Sultanate.
Malik sarwar began to rule as a defacto ruler of Jaunpur. Another province Malwa also
threw its allegiance to Delhi Sultanate and its ruler Mahmud Khalji expanded the bound-
aries of Malwa. Gujarat broke away from the Sultanate when its governor Zafar Khan
began ruling as an independent ruler. The most famous ruler of Gujarat was Ahmad
Shah who founded Ahmedabad. The most remarkable ruler of the provincial Kingdoms
was Zainal Abidin the ruler of Kashmir. Under him Kashmir became a strong and
prosperous state.  Bengal the Eastern most province of the Sultanate was annexed
many times to Delhi Sultanate but repeatedly gained its independence. Haji Iliyas united
Bengal which was divided into three administrative divisions by Delhi Sultanate.
Timur appointed Khizr Khan as the ruler of Multan, who laid the foundation of
Sayyid dynasty. This dynasty was replaced by Afghans as the Lodi dynasty
founded by Bahlol Lodi in AD 1451. Bahlol Lodi was a capable ruler who was
able to win the support of his nobles. He was followed by Sikander Lodi. The last
of the Lodis, Ibrahim Lodi was defeated by Babur in AD 1526 in the battle of
Panipat. The Delhi Sultanate which had its birth in AD 1192 breathed its last in
AD 1526 thus giving way to the establishment of the Mughal Empire.

ESTABLISHMENT OF THE MUGHAL
RULE
10
Notes
In the previous chapter you studied about the establishment and consolidation of Delhi
Sultanate (1206–1526). During this period the rulers were Turks and Afghans. You must
have noticed that throughout the Sultanate period there was constant struggle between
the various Turkish groups and Afghans. The disintegration of the Delhi Sultanate led to
the emergence of various regional powers. Therefore, when Babur invaded India in
1526 the central power of the Sultanate had substantially weakened and there were a
number of independent kingdoms. The Delhi and adjoining regions were under Sultan
Ibrahim Lodi. Other Important kingdoms were Gujarat, Malwa, Bengal, Bijapur, Golconda,
Ahmednagar, Berar, Mewar and Vijaynagar empire in the South. Besides, a large num-
ber of smaller autonomous chiefs were also ruling in different parts of the country.
In this lesson you will study about the conquest of India by a new ruling
dynasty-the Mughals. The Mughals were led by an able military commander and administra-
tor from Central Asia named Zahiruddin Muhammad Babur. His successors were success-
ful in establishing an all India empire gradually. We will study the details of this process of
conquests and consolidation in this lesson. Let us begin with the advent of Babur in India.
OBJECTIVES
After studying this lesson you would be able to:
 know the circumstances under which Babur invaded India;
 describe the reasons for the success of the Mughals against Indian rulers;
 list the challenges faced by Humayun after Babur’s death;
 analyse the circumstances that led to the defeat of Humayun and revival of
Afghan power;
 describe the events leading to recapture of India by Humayun;
 give an account of the expansion and consolidation of the Mughal empire under Akbar;
 describe the territorial expansion upto the reign of Aurangzeb and
 analyse the challenges faced by the Mughal empire in India.
10.1 ADVENT OF BABUR (1526–30)
Babur ascended the throne at Farghana, a small principality in Transoxiana, in 1494 at
the age of twelve after the death of his father. The situation in Central Asia was not"

stable and Babar had to face a lot of resistance from the nobility itself. Although he
was able to capture Samarqand but very soon he had to retreat because of desertion
of some of his nobles. He also lost Farghana to the Uzbegs.
Thus, the early years of Babur’s rule in central Asia were tough. During this whole
period he had plans of moving towards Hindustan. And finally from 1517 onwards he
made decisive moves towards India. A few developments in India at that time also
helped him to act on plans of invading India.
Timurids
Babur traced his linage from Timur the great conqueror of Central Asia and to
Chengiz Khan the distinguished conqueror.  From mother’s side he was a descen-
dant of Mongols and from father’s side the great commander Timur.  Because of
the lineage of Timur the Mughals are also referred as Timurids.
The unstable political situation in India after Sikandar Lodi’s death convinced him of politi-
cal discontentment and disorder in the Lodi Empire. Meanwhile there was conflict be-
tween some Afghan chiefs with Ibrahim Lodi. Prominent among them was Daulat Khan
Lodi, the Governor of a large part of Punjab. The Rajput king of Mewar Rana Sanga was
also asserting his authority against Ibrahim Lodi and was trying to increase his area of
influence in north India. Both of them sent word to Babur to invade India. Invitations from
Rana Sanga and Daulat Khan Lodi might have encouraged Babur’s ambitions.
Babur was successful in capturing Bhira (1519–1520), Sialkot (1520) and Lahore (1524)
in Punjab. Finally, Ibrahim Lodi and Babur’s forces met at Panipat in 1526. Babur’s Sol-
diers were less in number but the organization of his army was superior. Ibrahim Lodi was
defeated in the battle of Panipat. Success at the Battle of Panipat was a great achieve-
ment of Babur’s military tactics. Babur had an active army of only 12000 soldiers while
Ibrahim’s army had an estimated strength of 100,000 soldiers. When face to face in the
battle field Babur’s tactics were unique. He effectively applied the Rumi (Ottoman) method
of warfare. He encircled Ibrahim’s army from two flanks. In the centre his cavalry mounted
attack with arrows and gun fires by expert ottoman gunners. The trenches and barricades
provided adequate defence against march of the enemy. The Afghan army of Ibrahim
Lodi suffered heavy causalities. Ibrahim Lodi died in the battle field. Babur was thus able
to take control of Delhi and Agra and got the rich treasure of Lodis. This money was
distributed among Babur’s commanders and soldiers.
Victory at Panipat provided Babur a firm ground to consolidate his conquests. But
now he was faced with a few problems:
i. His nobles and commanders were eager to return to Central Asia because they
did not like the climate of India. Culturally also, they felt very alienated.
ii. Rajputs were rallying around under the leadership of Rana Sanga the king of
Mewar and wanted to expel the Mughal forces
iii. The Afghans, though defeated at Panipat, were still a formidable force in eastern
parts of UP, Bihar and Bengal. They were re-grouping to reclaim their lost powers.
To begin with Babur convinced his companions and nobles to stay back and help in
consolidating the conquered territories. After succeeding in this difficult task, he sent
his son Humayun to face the eastern Afghans. Rana Sanga of Mewar succeeded to"

muster support of a large number of Rajput chiefs. Prominent among these were
Jalor, Sirohi, Dungarpur, Amber, Merta etc. Medini Rai of Chanderi, Hasan Khan of
Mewat and Mahmud Lodi younger son of Sikander Lodi also joined Rana with their
forces. Possibly, Rana Sanga expected Babur to return to Kabul. Babur’s decision to
stay back must have given a big jolt to Rana Sanga’s ambitions. Babur was also fully
aware of the fact that it would be impossible for him to consolidate his position in India
unless he shattered Rana’s power. The forces of Babur and Rana Sanga met at
Khanwa, a place near Fatehpur Sikri. Rana Sanga was defeated in 1527 and once
again the superior military tactics of Babur succeeded. With the defeat of Rana the
biggest challenge in north India was shattered.
Though the Mewar Rajputs received great shock at Khanwa, Medini Rai at Malwa
was still threatening to challenge the authority of Babur. In spite of great valour with
which the Rajputs fought in Chanderi (1528), Babur faced little difficulty in overcom-
ing Medini Rai. With his defeat, resistance across Rajputana was completely shat-
tered. But Babur had to tackle the Afghans. The Afghans had surrendered Delhi, but

they were still powerful in the east (Bihar and parts of Jaunpur). The success against
the Afghans and Rajputs at Panipat and Khanwa was very significant but the resis-
tance was still present. However, these victories were a step forward in the direction
of the establishment of Mughal empire. Babur died in 1530. Still the rulers of Gujarat,
Malwa and Bengal enjoyed substantial military power and were not suppressed. It
was left to Humayun to face these regional powers.

2.2 HUMAYUN’S RETREAT AND AFGHAN REVIV AL (1530–1540)
After the death of Babur in 1530, his son Humayun succeeded him. The situation
under Humayun was quite desperate. The main problems faced by Humayun were:
i. The newly conquered territories and administration was not consolidated.
ii. Unlike Babur, Humayun did not command the respect and esteem of Mughal
nobility.
iii. The Chaghatai nobles were not favourably inclined towards him and the Indian nobles,
who had joined Babur’s service, deserted the Mughals at Humayun’s accession.
iv. He also confronted the hostility of the Afghans mainly Sher Khan in Bihar on the
one hand and Bahadurshah, the ruler of Gujarat, on the other.
v. As per the Timurid tradition Humayun had to share power with his brothers. The
newly established Mughal empire had two centres of power – Humayun was in
control of Delhi, Agra and Central India, while his brother Kamran had Afghanistan
and Punjab under him.
Humayun felt that the Afghans were a bigger threat. He wanted to avoid a combined
opposition of Afghans from east and the west. At that time Bahadur Shah had occupied
Bhilsa, Raisen, Ujjain and Gagron and was consolidating his power. While Humayun was
besieging Chunar in the east, Bahadur Shah had started expanding towards Malwa and
Rajputana. In such a situation Humayun was forced to rush back to Agra (1532–33).
Continuing his expansionist policy, Bahadur Shah attacked Chittor in 1534. Chittor had
strategic advantage as it could provide a strong base. It would have helped his expansion
in Rajasthan particularly towards Ajmer, Nagor and Ranthambhor. Humayun captured
Mandu and camped there because he thought that from here he can block Bahadur
Shah’s return to Gujarat. Humayun’s long absence from Agra resulted in rebellions in
Doab and Agra and he had to rush back. Mandu was now left under the charge of Mirza
Askari, the brother of Humayun. During the period when Humayun was busy in Gujarat
to check Bahadurshah, Sher Shah started consolidating himself in Bihar and Bengal."

HISTORY
 Establishment of the Mughal Rule
Rise of Sher Shah Suri
Farid, who later came to be called Sher Khan and subsequently Sher Shah, was son of a
Jagirdar under the kingdom of Jaunpur. His father Hasan Khan Sur held the jagir of
Sasaram in Bihar during the rule of Lodis. Sher Shah helped his father in the administra-
tion of his jagir. Later he developed differences with his father and left him. He served
under Afghan nobles. After the death of his father in 1524 he was given his father’s jagir
by Ibrahim Lodi. He had to enter into conflict with his family to take possession of the
jagir. He very effectively managed the Jagir of his father. He also acquired great mili-
tary and administrative skills. His capabilities made him the leader of Afghans. He gradu-
ally increased his influence and defeated Sultan Mahmud Shah of Bengal. He emerged
as the most powerful military commander in the eastern provinces. Sher Shah continued
consolidating his position in Bihar. He had to enter into a number of conflicts with promi-
nent Afghan nobles in Bihar and ruler of Bengal. He finally succeeded in establishing
himself as the most powerful Afghan chief in Eastern India.
Sher Shah wished to establish himself as the undisputed Afghan leader. He invaded
the Bengal army and defeated them in the battle of Surajgarh. Sher Shah could

extract quite a wealth from Bengal which helped him to raise a bigger army. Now he
started attacking Mughal territories of Banaras and beyond. Humayun was quite
suspicious of Sher Shah’s ambitions but failed to estimate his capabilities. He asked
his governor of Jaunpur, Hindu Beg to check the movements of Sher Shah. Mean-
while Sher Shah captured Gaur (1538) the capital of Bengal. While Humayun was
moving towards Bengal Sher Shah took control of route to Agra making communica-
tion difficult for Humayun. On the other hand, Hindal Mirza, brother of Humayun,
who was supposed to provide supplies for his army, declared his independence. Now,
Humayun decided to return to Chunar. When he reached Chausa (1539), he en-
camped on the western side of the river Karmnasa. Sher Shah attacked Humayun at
the bank of the river and defeated him. Sher Shah declared himself as an independent
king. Humayun could escape but most of his army was destroyed. With difficulty he
could reach Agra. His brother Kamran moved out of Agra towards Lahore leaving
Humayun with small force. Sher Shah now moved towards Agra. Humayun also
came forward with his army and the armies of the two clashed at Kannauj. Humayun
was defeated badly in the battle of Kannauj (1540).
10.3 SECOND AFGHAN EMPIRE (1540–1555)
Sher Shah
As already discussed the first Afghan kingdom under the Lodis was replaced by the
Mughals under Babur in 1526. After a gap of 14 years Sher Shah succeeded in
establishing the Afghan rule again in India in 1540. Sher Shah and his successors
ruled for 15 years. This period is known as the period of second Afghan Empire.
The founder of this Afghan rule Sher Khan was a great tactician and able military
commander. We have already discussed his conflict with Humayun. After de-
feating Humayun he became sovereign ruler in the year 1540 and assumed the
title of Sher Shah.
Sher Shah followed Humayun on his flight till Sindh in the North West. After expelling
Humayun he started consolidating his position in Northern and Eastern India. He
defeated and conquered Malwa in 1542 which was followed by Chanderi. In Rajasthan
he led campaigns against Marwar, Ranthambhore, Nagor, Ajmer, Merta Jodhpur and
Bikaner. He defeated rebellious Afghans in Bengal. By 1545 he had established him-
self as the supreme ruler from Sindh and Punjab to whole of Rajputana in the West
and Bengal in the East. Now he turned towards BundelKhand. Here while besieging
the fort of Kalinjar he died in 1545 in an accidental blast of gun powder.
During his brief rule Sher Shah introduced very important changes in administration
and revenue system. The most important ones were:
i. X judicial system.
Sher Shah was succeeded by his son Islam Shah. Islam Shah had to face a number of
conflicts with his brother Adil Khan and many Afghan nobles. He died in 1553. The
Afghan empire was substantially weakened. Humayun saw an opportunity and moved
towards India. He again captured his lost kingdom by 1555 and ended the second
Afghan Empire.
In 1555 Humayun conquered Agra and Delhi and established himself as the emperor
of India. Before he could consolidate his position he died after falling from the stairs
of the library at Sher Mandal (in Delhi) in 1556."

10.4 THE MUGHAL EMPIRE FROM AKBAR TO AURANGZEB
Akbar
Akbar was only thirteen years old at the time of Humayun’s death. When his father
died, Akbar was at Kalanaur in Punjab and therefore his coronation took place in Kalanaur
itself in 1556. It was his tutor and Humayun’s favourite and confidant Bairam Khan,
who served as the regent of the Mughal emperor from 1556 to 1560. He became the
wakil of the kingdom with the title of Khan-i-Khanan. One of the major achievements
of his regency period was the defeat of Hemu and the Afghan forces in the second
battle of Panipat in 1556, who were posing a serious threat to the Mughal Empire.
Regency of Bairam Khan 1556–1560
Bairam Khan remained at the helm of affairs of the Mughal Empire for almost four
years, which is popularly known as Period of Bairam Khan’s Regency. During this
phase he appointed his favourite nobles on important positions. Bairam Khan emerged
as the most powerful noble. He became very arrogant. A group of nobles were op-
posed to him. They managed to influence Akbar also. By this time Akbar also wanted
to assume full control. He removed Bairam Khan. Bairam Khan revolted and was
defeated. Akbar pardoned him and asked him to retire. He decided to go to Mecca for
pilgrimage. He was killed by an Afghan near Ahmedabad. His son later on became an
influential noble under Akbar and is famous as Abdur Rahim Khan-i-Khana.
Akbar started a policy of expansion after overcoming initial problems and consolidating his
hold on the throne. The major political powers spread in different parts of the country were:
i) the Rajputs who were spread throughout the country as independent chiefs and
kings, and were concentrated mainly in Rajasthan.
ii) The Afghans held political control mainly in Gujarat, Bihar and Bengal.
iii)Khandesh, Ahmednagar, Bijapur, Golkonda and few other kingdoms in South
India and Deccan were quite powerful.
iv) Kabul and Qandhar, though ruled by Mughal factions, were hostile towards Akbar.
Akbar through a systematic policy started the task of expanding his Empire. The first
step that Akbar took after the dismissal of Bairam Khan was to put an end to the
conflict within the nobility. He demonstrated great diplomatic skills and organizational"

capabilities in handling it. Akbar started his policy of expansion with central India. In
1559–60 the first expedition was sent to capture Gwalior before moving towards
Malwa. Malwa in central India was ruled by Baz Bahadur. Akbar deputed Adham
Khan to lead the expedition against it. Baz Bahadur was defeated and fled towards
Burhanpur. Gondwana, an independent state in Central India ruled by Rani Durgawati,
widow of Dalpat Shah, was conquered and annexed to the Mughal empire in 1564.
Rajasthan
It seems that Akbar was fully aware of the importance of Rajput kingdoms and wanted
them as allies in his ambition of establishing a large empire. He tried to win over the
Rajputs wherever possible and inducted them into Mughal service. He also entered into
matrimonial alliances with the Rajput rulers like Bharmal. Raja Bharmal of Amber was
the first to enter into alliance with Akbar. The Rajput kingdoms like Merta and Jodhpur
were also occupied without much resistance. However, Maharana Pratap, the ruler of
Mewar posed most serious challenge to the Mughal emperor and did not submit before
Akbar. After a prolonged struggle and siege of the fort of Chittor, Akbar succeeded in
defeating the Mewar forces. A large number of Rajput soldiers got killed in the war.
However, it could not be fully subdued and some resistance from Mewar side continued
for a long time. After the fall of Chittor Ranthambhor and Kalinjar were captured. Marwar,
Bikaner and Jaisalmer also submitted to Akbar. By 1570 Akbar had captured almost the
whole of Rajasthan. The most important achievement of Akbar was that in spite of the
subjugation of the whole of Rajasthan there was no hostility between the Rajputs and the
Mughals. We will discuss reasons for it in a separate section in this lesson.
Afghans (Gujarat, Bihar and Bengal)
Akbar’s compaign against Afghans started with Gujarat in 1572. One of the princes,
Itimad Khan, had invited Akbar to come and conquer it. Akbar himself marched to
Ahmedabad. The town was captured without any serious resistance. Surat with a strong
fortress offered some resistance but was also captured. In a short time most of the
principalities of Gujarat were brought under his control. Akbar organized Gujarat into a
province and placed it under Mirza Aziz Koka and returned to capital. Within six months
various rebellious groups came together and revolted against the Mughal rule and the
Mughal governor had to cede a number of territories. The leaders of rebellion were
Ikhitiyar ul Mulk and Mohammad Hussain Mirza. Akbar got the news of rebellion in
Agra and he set out for Ahmadabad. Akbar marched at a rapid pace and managed to
reach Ahmedabad in ten days. The emperor quickly suppressed the rebellion.
Bengal and Bihar which were under the control of the Afghans, were paid attention
after the Gujarat expedition. In 1574, Akbar along with Munim Khan Khan-i-Khanan
marched towards Bihar. In a short time, Hajipur and Patna were captured and Gaur
(Bengal) was also taken away. With this the independent rule of Bengal was ended in
1576. By 1592, the Mughal mansabdar Raja Man Singh also brought the whole of
Orissa under the Mughal rule.
A series of conflicts arose in some regions of the Mughal empire in 1581. Bengal,
Bihar, Gujarat and the north-west were main centres of unrest. The Afghans were at
the root of these problems since they were overthrown everywhere by the Mughals.
Apart from this, Akbar’s policy of strict administration of jagirs was also responsible
for this. A new policy was adopted, according to which the jagirdars were asked to
submit the accounts of the jagirs. This created dissatisfaction and jagirdars rose in
revolt. Masum Khan Kabuli, Roshan Beg, Mirza Sharfuddin and Arab Bahadur were
the main leader of rebels. Imperial officers posted there tried to crush the rebellion"

but failed. Akbar immediately sent a large force under Raja Todar Mal and Shaikh
Farid Bakshi. A little later, Aziz Koka and Shahbaz Khan were also sent to help Todar
Mal. The rebels declared Akbar’s brother Hakim Mirza, who was in Kabul, as their
king. But soon the Mughal forces were able to successfully crush the rebellion in
Bihar, Bengal and adjoining regions.
Punjab and North West
In the Punjab, Mirza Hakim was creating problems for Akbar and he attacked Lahore
Hakim Mirza was expecting a number of Mughal officers to join him but no large group
joined him. Akbar decided to march towards Lahore himself. Hakim Mirza immediately
retreated and Akbar controlled the whole region. He gave first priority to organize the
protection of North-West frontiers. After this he marched towards Kabul and conquered
the territory. Akbar gave the charge of Kabul to his sister Bakhtunnisa Begum. Later on
Raja Man Singh was appointed governor of Kabul and it was given to him in jagir.
Another important development in the North-West region was the rebellion of Roshanai
who captured the road between Kabul and Hindustan. Roshanai was a sect estab-
lished by a soldier who was called Pir Roshanai in the region. His son Jalala was
heading the sect who had large following. Akbar appointed Zain Khan as commander
of a strong force to suppress the Roshanais and establish Mughal control in the re-
gion. Sayid Khan Gakhar and Raja Birbal were also sent with separate forces to help
Zain Khan. In one of the operations Birbal was killed with most of his forces. Akbar
was greatly disturbed with the death of his trusted friend Birbal. He deputed Raja
Todar Mal and Raja Man Singh to suppress the rebellion and they were successful in
defeating the Roshanais. Akbar for a long time had his eyes set on conquering Kash-
mir. It was annexed to the Mughal Empire in 1586.
Some pockets in Sindh in the North-West were still independent. In 1590 Akbar ap-
pointed Khan-i-Khanna as governor of Multan and asked him to subdue Bilochis, a
tribe in the region and conquer the whole territory. First, Thatta was annexed and
placed as a sarkar in the suba of Multan. The conflict with Bilochis in the adjoining
regions continued. Finally, by the year 1595, the complete supremacy of Mughals
over North-West region was established.
Deccan
After 1590, Akbar gave shape to a Deccan policy to bring these states under Mughal
control. During this period the Deccan states were facing internal tensions and regu-
lar conflicts. In 1591, Akbar sent offers to the Deccan states asking them to accept
Mughal sovereignty, but there was not much success. Now Akbar decided on a policy
of agression. The first expedition was dispatched to Ahmednagar under the command
of Prince Murad and Abdul Rahim Khan Khanan. In 1595, the Mughal forces in-
vaded Ahmednagar. Its ruler Chand Bibi decided to face the Mughals. She approached
Ibrahim Adil Shah of Bijapur and Qutub Shah of Golkonda for help but with no suc-
cess. A fierce conflict followed. After heavy losses on both sides, a treaty was worked
out and Chand Bibi ceded Berar to Mughals. After some time Chand Bibi attacked
Berar to take it back. At this point Nizamshahi, Qutabshahi and Adilshahi troops
decided to present a joint front. The Mughals suffered heavy losses but could retain
their position. Meanwhile, serious differences between Murad and Khan Khana weak-
ened Mughal position. Akbar, therefore, recalled Khan Khanan and deputed Abul
Fazl to Deccan. After Prince Murad’s death in 1598, Prince Daniyal and Khan Khanan
were sent to Deccan. Ahmednagar was captured. Soon the Mughals also conquered
Asirgarh and adjoining regions. Adil shah of Bijapur also expressed allegiance and"

offered his daughter in marriage to Prince Daniyal. Meanwhile Chand Bibi also died. Now
Mughal territories in Deccan included Asirgarh, Burhanpur, Ahmedanagar and Berar.
Along with the expansion of territory Akbar initiated the policy of absorbing the chief-
tains into Mughal nobility. His policy paid rich dividends to the empire. The Mughal
emperor succeeded in getting the support of chieftains and their armies for new con-
quests. As part of Mughal nobility, their help was also available for administering a
large empire. In addition, a friendly relationship with them ensured peace for the
empire. The chieftains also benefited from this policy. Now they could retain their
territories and administer them as they wished. In addition, they received jagir and
mansab. (You would learn about these administrative measures in lesson 12 of Mod-
ule 2). Often they got territories in jagir bigger than their kingdoms. It also provided
them security from enemies and rebellions. Many Rajput mansabdars were assigned
their own territories as Watan Jagir, which was hereditary and non-transferable.
The territorial expansion under Akbar gave a definite shape to the Mughal Empire. In
terms of territorial expansion very little was added to the empire after Akbar. Some
territories were added during the regions of Shahjahan and Aurangzeb in the Deccan
and North East of India.

Jahangir and Shahjahan
Jahangir decided to follow Akbar’s expansionist policy in the Deccan. But Jahangir
could achieve little success in it due to certain problems. He could not devote much
attention in the crucial phase due to Khurram’s revolt. The Mughal nobles were also
involved in a number of intrigues and conflicts to gain some advantages from Deccan.
During the first three years, the Deccan regained half of Balaghat and many districts
of Ahmednagar. Malik Ambar was the main ruler who managed to defeat Mughal
forces and captured Berar, Balaghat and parts of Ahmednagar. The Mughals could
not regain control of the lost territories. Meanwhile Shah Jahan revolted against his
father and became friends with Malik Ambar.
Malik Ambar made an attempt to capture Ahmednagar; but failing there, he took
away Sholapur from Adil Shah and in alliance with Shah Jahan tried to capture
Burhanpur but failed. Once peace was established between Jahangir and Shah Jahan.
Malik Ambar was also pacified. Malik Ambar died in 1627 and was succeeded by his
son Fath Khan as Wakil and Peshwa of the kingdom. Fath Khan was arrogant and
during his time the conflict between the Dakhnis and other nobles grew.
During the reign of Jahangir there was no addition to the Mughal territory in Deccan.
In fact the Deccani rulers weakened the Mughal authority in their states. Over ambi-
tion of Malik Ambar was an obstacle in the way of a joint front of the Deccan states.
During the period between the death of Jahangir and the accession of Shah Jahan, the
Mughal governor of the Deccan, Khan Jahan Lodi, with the intention of securing help
in times of necessity, gave away Balaghat to the Nizam Shah. After ascending the
throne, Shah Jahan ordered Khan Jahan Lodi to recover it but as the latter failed,
Shah Jahan recalled him to court. Khan Jahan turned hostile and rebelled. He took
shelter with Nizam Shah. This infuriated Shah Jahan and he decided to follow aggres-
sive policy towards the Deccan states. Shah Jahan’s main concern was to recover
the lost territories of the Deccan. He believed that independence of Ahmednagar was
in the way of Mughal control in the Deccan. He decided to isolate Ahmednagar and
win over Bijapur and Marathas. He was successful. Fath Khan son of Malik Ambar
also made peace with Mughals. Now Mahabat Khan was appointed governor of
Deccan. But the conflict with Deccan states continued. Finally in 1636 treaties were
signed with Bijapur and Golconda. The main points of agreement with Bijapur were:"

i. Adil Shah accepted the Mughal suzerainty
ii. He was to pay 20 lakh rupees as indemnity
iii. He was not to interfere in the affairs of Golconda
iv. Mughal emperor was to arbitrate in case of any dispute between Bijapur and
Golconda
v. Adil Shah to help Mughals in conflict against Shahji Bhonsle
Golconda also made a separate treaty. According to this treaty:
i. Golconda took oath of loyalty towards Mughal emperor. He agreed to include the
name of the Mughal emperor in Khutba and exclude the name of Shah of Iran.
ii. Golconda agreed to pay two lakh huns per year to the Mughals.
The treaties ended the conflicts in the Deccan. The Mughals could expand their area
of dominance to large parts of Southern India. A distinct change in Mughal policy
came towards 1656–57 when the treaties were ignored. Now, Shah Jahan asked
Aurangzeb to conquer and annex the territories of Deccan kingdoms. It is argued by
some historians that this change of policy was to exploit resources of the Deccan
states for Mughals. However, this change did not benefit the Mughal empire in any
substantial way and created more problems for future.
Aurangzeb
Aurangzeb believed in an aggressive policy towards Deccan. Prof. Satish Chandra
identifies three distinct phases in his policy towards Deccan states.
i. From 1658 to 1668 the focus was to get hold of the territories of Kalyani, Bidar
and Parenda from Bijapur. During this phase attempts were made to secure the
help of Deccan states against Marathas. The efforts were also made by Jai
Singh, the governor of Deccan, to conquer Bijapur but the efforts failed.
ii. From around 1668 to 1684 there was a shift in the policy. The death of Adil Shah of
Bijapur, growing power of Shivaji and increasing influence of Akhanna and Madanna
two brothers in Golconda administration affected the Mughal policy. Golconda tried to
forge an alliance with Shivaji and Bijapur. Aurangzeb’s efforts to contain Marathas
were not very successful. The alliance with minor shifts and frequent tensions contin-
ued in some form or the other. Aurangzeb was not inclined to annex the Deccan states.
iii. In the third phase (1684–87) Aurangzeb followed the policy of outright annex-
ation of the Deccan states. Aurangzeb personally supervised the siege of Bijapur.
By 1687 both Bijapur and Golconda along with the territory of Karnataka were
annexed in the Mughal empire. The conflict with Marathas continued from 1687
to 1707 Aurangzeb spent most of his time in Deccan and could manage to keep
the region under Mughal control. But after his death in 1707 (at Aurangabad in
Deccan) they reasserted independence and succeeded in a short period.
Apart from Deccan Aurangzeb could expand Mughal power in Assam in the north-
east region. The major success of the Mughals in this region was annexation of Ahom
kingdom (Assam) under Mir Jumla, the governor of Bengal. Another notable achieve-
ment in north-east was capture of Chatgaon in 1664 under Shaista Khan the new
governor of Bengal. The Ahom kingdom could not be directly controlled for long. The
Mughal faujdars posted there had to face resistance and there were regular con-
flicts. By 1680 Ahoms succeeded in capturing Kamrup and Mughal control ended."

10.5 CHALLENGES TO MUGHAL RULE: CONFLICTS
AND NEGOTIATIONS
Under Aurangzeb, the Mughal empire reached its greatest territorial limits and it covered
almost the whole of present day India. But his reign was marred by popular revolts of the
Jats, Satnamis, Afghans, Sikhs and the Marathas. The Rajputs emerged as an important
support base of the Mughals under Akbar, and later on under Jahangir and Shah Jahan.
However under Aurangzeb they started feeling alienated and gradually lost their position in
administrative set up. The Marathas posed a major challenge to the sovereignty of the
Mughals under Aurangzeb. Deccan states put up a stiff resistance against Mughal expan-
sion plans. The North-West frontier region was also trouble spot and Mughals had to sup-
press disturbances. Thus we notice that in the process of the establishment and expansion of
Mughal empire the Mughals faced resistance and had to negotiate their way through diverse
means and strategies. Here we will provide a brief discussion on all these issues.
Rajputs
Mewar was the only region in Rajputana that had not come under the Mughals during
Akbar’s time. Jahangir followed a persistant policy to capture it. After a series of con-
flicts, Rana Amar Singh finally agreed to accept Mughal Suzerainty. All the territories
taken from Mewar including the fort of Chittor were returned to Rana Amar Singh and a
substantial jagir was granted to his son Karan Singh. During the reigns of Jahangir and
Shah Jahan, the Rajputs generally continued to be friendly with the Mughals and held very
high mansabs. Shah Jahan relied upon Rajput soldiers for his campaigns in Deccan and
the North West. During the reign of Aurangzeb, the Mughal relations with Rajputs suf-
fered, particularly over the issue of the successor to the throne of Marwar. Aurangzeb’s
interference in the succession dispute and his support to the rival candidate antagonised
the Rajputs. His occupation of Jodhpur further put a dent on the Mughal-Rajput relation
and the Rajputs gradually got alienated from Mughal rule. In fact, the absence of a pow-
erful Rajput section in the nobility ultimately proved detrimental to the Mughal control of
the peripheral areas, specially when it came to negotiating with the Marathas.
Deccan
During the last years of Akbar and early years of Jahangir, Ahmednagar under Malik
Ambar started challenging Mughal power. Malik Ambar succeeded in getting support
of Bijapur also. A number of expeditions were sent by Jahangir but failed to achieve
any success. During Shahjahan’s reign, Mughal conflict with the Deccan kingdoms
of Ahmednagar, Bijapur and Golconda was revived. Aghmednagar was first to be"

defeated and most of its territories were annexed into Mughal empire. By 1636, Bijapur and
Golkonda were also defeated but these kingdom were not annexed to the Mughal Empire.
After a treaty the defeated rulers were to pay annual tributes and recognise Mughal author-
ity. For almost ten years Shahjahan deputed his son Aurangzeb in the region. During Aurangzeb’s
reign the struggle with Deccan state and Marathas became more intensive. In fact, Aurangzeb
spent the last twenty years of his reign in Deccan fighting against them. By 1687, the Deccani
kingdoms of Bijapur and Golkonda were annexed to the Mughal Empire. However, the time
and money spent in the Deccan by Aurangzeb proved a great drain on the Mughal empire.
The Marathas
The Marathas emerged in the Deccan as a vital force under Shivaji in the middle of
the 17th century and began to challenge the Mughal authority. Shiviji started his offen-
sive operations in 1656 and captured the principality of Javli. After some time, Shivaji
raided the Bijapur territory, and, in 1659, the Sultan of Bijapur sent his general, Afzal
Khan, to capture Shivaji. But Shivaji was too clever for him (Afzal Khan) and killed
him. Ultimately, in 1662, the Sultan of Bijapur entered into a peace settlement with
Shivaji and acknowledged him as an independent ruler of his conquered territories.
Shivaji now began to devastate the Mughal territories. Aurangzeb sent Shaista Khan,
the viceroy of the Deccan, with a big army against Shivaji and the Treaty of Purandhar
(1665) was signed between the two. Out of the 35 forts held by Shivaji, he agreed to
surrender 23 forts to the Mughals. The remaining 12 forts (with annual income of one
lakh of huns) were to be left with Shivaji. Shivaji was asked to pay a visit to the Mughal
court at Agra. But, when Shivaji went there, he was ill-treated and was taken a prisoner.
He managed to escape, reaching Raigarh in 1666. From then onwards, he waged a
relentless struggle against the Mughals. Soon he conquered all the forts which he had
surrendered to the Mughals. In 1670, he plundered Surat for the second time.
In 1674, Shivaji made Raigarh his Capital and celebrated his coronation, and assumed
the title of Chatrapati. Shortly, after this, he made a great expedition into southern
India and conquered Jinji Vellore and many forts in Karnataka. He died at Raigarh in
1680 after ruling for only six years. In this short time he founded the Maratha king-
dom, which dominated western India for a century and a half.
Shivaji’s successor was his son Sambhaji. Many Maratha chiefs did not support
Sambhaji and extended help to Rajaram the other son of Shivaji. The internal conflict
weakened Maratha power. Finally Sambhaji was captured and put to death in 1689 by
Aurangzeb. Sambhaji was succeeded by Rajaram as his son Sahu was still young. Rajaram
died in 1700. He was succeeded by his minor son Shivaji III under the regency of Tara
Bai, his mother. The failure of Aurangzeb against the Marathas was largely due to Tara
Bai’s energy and administrative genius. The Mughals, however, succeeded in dividing the
Marathas into two rival camps-one under Tara Bai and the other under Sambhaji’s son,
Sahu. Sahu, who for long was in the Mughal court, was released. He succeeded in depos-
ing Tara Bai with the help of a Chitpavan Brahman named Balaji Vishwanath.
North West
Akbar had always considered the Kabul-Ghazni-Qandhar line as the stragetic fron-
tier and therefore, captured Qandhar in 1595.
During the 17th century the North-west frontier was the main area of activity of the
Mughals. Here, the Roshanais were decisively defeated by 1625–26, but Qandhar
became a region of conflict between the Persians and Mughals. After Akbar’s death,
the Persians, tried to capture Qandhar but failed under Shah Abbas I, the Safavi ruler."

Following this, Shah Abbas I in 1620 requested Jahangir to hand over Qandhar to him
but the latter declined to do so. In 1622, after another attack, Qandhar was captured by
the Persians. Under Shah Jahan, Qandhar once again came into the Mughal hands, but
was recaptured by the Persians in 1649. The struggle to capture Qandahar continued till
Aurangzeb’s reign but Mughals got little success. Shah Jahan’s Balkh campaign to keep
the Uzbeks (tribe) under control failed miserably and the Mughals lost huge amount of
money and men in the conflict. During the reign of Aurangzeb, the Qandhar issue was
dropped and diplomatic relations with Persia were revived.
It is quite evident that the territorial expansion of Mughal empire achieved under
Akbar continued to be the core of the empire. Its further expansion during Aurangzeb’s
reign was in Deccan and in small measure in North-East region. During his period the

WHAT YOU HA VE LEARNT
After the disintegration of the Delhi Sultanate Babur was able to establish the Mughal
empire in India in 1526. It was both the circumstances in Central Asia and in India
which played a major role in the foundation of the Mughal empire. Before Babur
could lay the foundation of the Mughal empire, he had to fight many wars with local
ruling kingdoms. He defeated Ibrahim Lodi at Panipat in 1526. Then he defeated one
of the biggest forces in north India, Rana Sanga in 1527. After Babur’s death in 1530
his son Humayun succeeded him. When Humayun was busy in Gujarat, Sher Shah
started consolidating himself in Bihar and Bengal and moved towards Agra. Humayun
was defeated in the battle of Kannauj in 1540 and Sher Shah was able to establish the
second Afghan empire which continued from 1540 to 1555. However, in 1555 Humayun
was again successful in capturing Agra, Delhi and other lost territories from the Af-
ghans and re–established the Mughal rule. After Humayun’s sudden death Akbar
became the emperor at a tender age of 13 and Bairam Khan was made the regent.
Akbar followed a policy of expansion after consolidating his hold on throne. He won
over the Rajput kingdoms to his side either through matrimonial alliances or by invad-
ing the territories. He brought Gujarat, Bihar, Bengal, Punjab and the whole of north-
west under the Mughal control. He also annexed Ahmednagar, Berar, Burhanpur,
Asisgarh etc. in the Deccan. Jahangir also followed the expansionist policy in the
Deccan. But he could not get much success here and lost few of the territories.
Shahjahan was able to take control of Bijapur and Golconda in 1636. Aurangzeb also
followed an aggressive policy in the Deccan and remained involved in conflict with
the Marathas for most of his rule. Under Aurangzeb, the Mughal empire reached its
greatest territorial limits. Ironically, the decline of the Mughal empire also began un-
der Aurangzeb. There was a break up of the association with regional forces like the
Rajputs and the Marathas."

EMERGENCE OF REGIONAL
STATES IN INDIA: TWELFTH TO
EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
11
Notes
There are twenty-eight states in India today. Each of these states has a specific
language, geography, food and culture that make the culture of India rich and full of
varieties. Have you wondered how these different states and the regional cultures in
them developed? Were they like this from time immemorial? When we go back to
history, we realise that these states existed in different forms undergoing a constant
process of change in different periods of time.
In this lesson, you will study the history of various regional states that existed from
twelfth to eighteenth century. Some of the regional states of this period are today a part of
one single state. For example, Jaipur, Jodhpur, and Udaipur that existed as independent
regional states in the medieval period are all today districts of the state of Rajasthan.
Some of the regional states are now a part of more than one state. For example, the
Vijayanagar Empire (1336–1565AD) is now a part of the modern states of Karnataka,
Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. There are some regional states that had the same
names as those of the modern states today, but were different in terms of areas they
covered. For example, the modern states of Gujarat, Bengal, Kashmir and Orissa existed
from twelfth and eighteenth century under same names, but their respective geography
today is different from what it was in the period between twelfth and eighteenth century.
OBJECTIVES
After studying this lesson you will be able to:
 give brief account of different regional states from twelfth to eighteenth century.
 Understand the meaning of the term regional states?
 Understand the nature of relations between the regional states and the Delhi
Sultanate and the Mughal Empire.
 appreciate the relations between various regional states themselves
 Describe the political ideas and organisations of these regional states.

 Emergence of Regional States
1. From north India, we will look at the history of two regional states one Jaunpur,
which is today in Uttar Pradesh and another Kashmir.
2. From south India, we will study the history of the Vijayanagara and Bahamani
kingdom. As stated earlier, the Vijayanagar Empire can be found in current
states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu and the Bahamani king-
dom can be found in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra.
3. From west India we will study Gujarat, and the Marathas. Gujarat exists with
the same name today, and the Marathas had control over today’s Maharashtra,
Tamil Nadu and some other parts of India.
4. Finally, from eastern India we will study the history of Bengal.
11.1 THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE TERM REGIONAL STATE
AND REGIONALISM:
In the history of India, there has been a constant evolution and development of re-
gionalism and regional states. How does one explain the rise of regional states? From
the seventh century AD onwards which is the early medieval period till the seven-
teenth and eighteenth centuries, agriculture and agricultural activities played a very
significant role in the development of regional states. Wherever, good agricultural
activity took place, it not only fed the population but generated a large surplus that
could be sold and wealth could be generated. Trade and trading activities, overland as
well as maritime, also provided an important source of revenue. One finds the rise of
powerful sections in the society that controlled the agricultural surplus. Sometimes,
some members of this powerful section asserted themselves and acquired political
power and became kings and established ruling dynasties. This led to laying the foun-
dation of the states. Sometimes, some groups came from outside and conquered the
land, controlled the administration and became powerful.
It is true that a large number of regional states after thirteenth century arose due to
internal weakness of the Delhi Sultanate. Similarly, with the decline of Mughal Empire,
there emerged important states in the eighteenth century. But all these states had a
regional history that pre-dated both the Sultanate and the Mughal state. For example,
Bengal was an important regional kingdom in the eighth and the ninth centuries under
the Palas and subsequently in the twelfth century under the Senas. It was an important
independent state in the thirteenth and fifteenth century and became a powerful provin-
cial kingdom in the eighteenth century too. We all know that Delhi Sultanate and the
Mughal Empire ruled over numerous and different cultural zones. Even the regional
state of Vijayanagar ruled over different cultural zones. Therefore, it should be remem-
bered that regionalism never disappeared though the regional dynasties gained and lost
power and the regions changed their geographical boundaries.
What is this regionalism? Apart from political features, like regional ruling dynasties,
there are some important characteristics of regionalism which developed, evolved
and changed over a period of time in these regional states. Some of the characteris-
tics of regionalism are as follows:
1. One of the important aspects is language. For example, Oriya, Gujarati, Bengali,
Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Marathi and so on Indian languages spoken in vari-
ous regions of India are referred as regional languages. These languages devel-
oped in the early medieval and medieval period and were associated with the
specific regions. Though the languages existed in some form or the other, even
prior to this but it was primarily from the eleventh and twelfth centuries, that the"

HISTORY
 Emergence of Regional States
regional languages came to be used in the official documents. Literary works and
local literature came to be written in these languages. In the medieval period, simul-
taneous with the use of the regional languages, Sanskrit also came to be used in
scholastic texts. However a large number of official documents of the Delhi Sul-
tanate and the Mughal Empire and some regional states were written in Persian.
2. Another characteristic is the presence of the local regional cults and religious
affiliations. For instance, the cult of Jagannath in Orissa was regional to Orissa.
It became the cult of the state, whereby the rulers adopted it, built a huge temple
for it and celebrated festivals around it every year. Historians say that Jagannath
was a tribal god, whose popularity made the rulers adopt this as the state cult. In
the next section, we will further elaborate about the relationship between the
states and religion. A large number of sects and the bhakti religion developed in
the regions. For example, Namdev, Raidas, Tukaram, Guru Nanak were located
in the regional states. Religions also have their own myths, legends and interpreta-
tions and religious practices. Did you know that in north India, Kartikeya, the son of
Shiva and Parvati, is a bachelor and in the Tamil region he has two wives, Devyani
and Valli? Each region had different gods and goddesses, different temple and mosque
architectures. Interestingly, despite these regional differences, where each tradition
was specific to a region, there were similarities in the regional traditions too. The
saints and priests migrated from one region to another. For instance, Gesu Daraz,
(1321–1422), the Sufi saint, belonged to the Chisti Silsilah that was established in
Delhi. He migrated from Delhi to Daultabad in the Deccan region as a child in 1328.
Seven years later, in 1335 AD, he came back to Delhi and stayed there for sixty three
years. Towards the end of fourteenth century, in 1398, when Timur, a Turkish invader
from Central Asia attacked Delhi, Gesu Daraz, migrated back to Deccan.
3. The regional states were not closed isolated areas. Apart from religious interac-
tion between the states, there were networks of interaction through trade and
commerce and migration of artisans from one region to another. For example, in
the fifteenth century, the silk weavers, Pattanulkars migrated from the Gujarat
region to the Vijayanagar state. Also one finds migration of the Africans and
Iranians to the Vijayanagar and Bahamani kingdoms.
4.  Another characteristic is the development of local and regional art schools like
that Bihar, Bengal, Assam, Central India, and Rajasthan and so on. Regional
identities were formed as a result of process and there have been changes and
they did not exist since time immemorial. The various regional dynasties ex-
tended their patronage to art, culture, literature and architecture.
Thus, the presence of numerous regional states did not imply chaos and confusion.
These states did wage wars amongst themselves, but provided stability over their
respective regions. As discussed above, they had a vibrant culture of their own. The
regional states influenced each other in the area of architecture and political culture.
For instance, the early Vijayanagar rulers called themselves as Hindu Suratrana,
meaning Hindu Sultan, where the term Sultan was borrowed from the Delhi sultan-
ate. Similarly, the iqtadari system of the Delhi Sultanate influenced the administrative
systems of the Vijayanagar and Bahamani kingdoms.
What is the difference between the regional states and Empire like Delhi Sultanate
and the Mughal Empire? Apart from the characteristics mentioned above of language
and culture that were specific to one area, the political and military visions of these
states were limited by the regional boundaries."

11.2 RISE OF REGIONAL STATES: A GENERAL HISTORY
In the lessons you have studied about the regional states from the seventh to the thirteenth
century. What happened to these states? Did they disappear completely from medi-
eval Indian politics? A large number of these regional states continued to exist after
the thirteenth century but there were changes in the ruling dynasties and geography
of these states. In this section, you will get a general overview of the regional states
from the thirteenth to the eighteenth century.
The Delhi Sultanate expanded as a result of the annexation of the states like Bengal,
Bihar, Gujarat, Malwa, various Rajput states of Rajasthan, like Ranthambor, Jalore,
Nagore, Ajmer, the Deccan states of Warangal, Telengana, Yadavas of Deogir, and the
southern states of the Hoysalas of Dwarsamudra, Pandyas of Madurai, and so on. We
have already studied about the various campaigns of Alauddin Khalji and the shift of
capital from Delhi to Daultabad in the Deccan, during Mohammad bin Tughlaq’s period.
Those states that were annexed to the Sultanate formed various provinces and were
placed under the administration of the provincial governors. From the establishment of
the Delhi Sultanate in the thirteenth century till its downfall in the fifteenth century, there
was a constant interaction between the provinces that were once upon a time indepen-
dent states and the centre, that is, Delhi. However, rebellions from these areas never
seized. We all know that as a prince, Muhammmad bin Tughlaq spent his entire career
in crushing the rebellions in the Deccan, Orissa and Bengal.
Though these regions were now a part of the Delhi Sultanate, the regional character-
istics of language, art, literature and religion remained. In fact, when Islam reached
here, it acquired a regional flavour. These states already had settlements of Muslim
merchants and Muslims employed in the army. Though there was hardly any regional
ruling dynasty, the provincial governors of the Sultanate allied with the local rajas and
zamindars and asserted their independence. Most of the regional states that came up
after the fourteenth century when the Delhi Sultanate was declining were a result of
the rebellions of the governors. The establishment of Vijayanagar and the Bahamani
were a result of the assertion of power by the provincial officers, like Harihara and
Bukka and Alauddin Hasan Bahman Shah respectively. During the same period, Ben-"

gal in the east and Multan and Sind in the west became independent. Feroz Shah
Tughlaq tried to regain the lost territories but could not do so. He tried unsuccessfully
to take over Bengal. He attacked and plundered Jajnagar (Orissa) but did not annex
it. He plundered Kangra and suppressed revolts in Gujarat and Thatta.
With the death of Feroz Shah Tughlaq in 1338, the decline of the Sultanate began. As we
have just mentioned, a large number of local governors became powerful and asserted
their independence in the provinces. The relationship between the Sultan and the nobles
worsened. The conflict with the local rulers and zamindars as well as regional and
geographical tensions weakened the Sultanate further. The declining Sultanate received
the final blow with the invasions of Timur in 1398 AD. Timur was a Turk who had come
from Central Asia to plunder the wealth of India. Timur entered Delhi and mercilessly
killed both the Hindus and Muslims and massacred women and children as well.
Fifteen years after the Timur’s raids in Delhi, the Delhi Sultanate declined. The Sul-
tanates in Gujarat, Malwa and Jaunpur near Varanasi emerged as powerful regional king-
dom. Gujarat and Jaunpur were constantly engaged in tension with the Lodhis of the Delhi
Sultanate (1451 to 1526 AD). New regional states independent of the Delhi sultanate arose
in Central and South India too, out of which the prominent ones were the Gajapatis of Orissa,
the Bahamanis and the Vijayanagara Empire. The Lodhi Sultans like Bahlol Lodhi (1451–
1485) and Sikander Lodhi (1489–1526) tried to keep these regional kingdoms under control.
Finally, during the rule of Ibrahim Lodhi (1517–1526), Bihar declared its independence. Daulat
Khan, the governor of Punjab rebelled and invited Babur to invade India in 1526.
With the establishment of the Mughal Empire in 1526 AD, and its expansion in the later
period, the ruling dynasties in the regional states gradually lost their power and these
states over a period of time became the part of the Mughal Empire. But the regional
features of language, art, literature and religion continued with changes. With the decline
of the Mughals in the eighteenth century, there were rebellions of the provincial governors
and a few annexed states declared their independence. As a result new regional king-
doms arose, for instance, Punjab, Bengal, Awadh, Hyderabad, Mysore and the Marathas.

HISTORY OF THE REGIONAL STATES: A FEW CASE STUDIES
11.3 JAUNPUR:
Jaunpur is now in Varanasi division in eastern Uttar Pradesh on the banks of river
Gomati. It was a prosperous province in the eastern part of the Delhi Sultanate. The
governor of Jaunpur was Malik Sarwar, who was a prominent noble during Feroz
Shah Tughlaq’s period. In 1394, Sultan Nasiruddin Mohammad Shah Tughlaq made
him a minister and gave him the title of Sultanu-Sharq which means the master of
the east. Thereafter, he was known as Malik Sarwar Sultanus Sharq. After Timur’s
invasion and the weakening of the Delhi Sultanate, Malik Sarwar took advantage of a
weak political situation and declared himself independent. Malik Sarwar was"

succeeded by his son Mubarak Shah Sharqi. The Sultan struck coins in his name.
During his period, the ruler of the Delhi sultanate was Mahmud Shah Tughlaq, who tried to
annex Jaunpur, but failed. Thereafter, there were constant tensions between the various
rulers of Jaunpur and Delhi Sultanate. The Sharqi Sultans made several attempts to con-
quer Delhi, but they could never be successful. In 1402, Ibrahim Shah Sharqi, Mubarak
Shah’s brother became the Sultan and ruled Jaunpur for thirty four years. Ibrahim was
also a scholar, well versed with Islamic theology and law, music and fine arts. He was a
great patron of architecture. A distinct style of architecture evolved called the Sharqi style
that had some Hindu influence. At its height, the Sharqi Sultanate extended from Aligarh in
western Uttar Pradesh to Darbhanga in north Bihar in the east and from Nepal in the
north to Bundelkhand in the south. It was during the reign of Hussain Shah Sharqi (1458–
1505) that a prolonged war with Bahlol Lodhi started. Bahlol Lodhi attacked Jaunpur in
1484 and Hussain Shah had to flee. Finally, Sikandar Lodhi who succeeded Bahlol Lodhi
annexed Jaunpur. Hussain Shah died and the Sharqi dynasty came to an end.
11.4 KASHMIR
Kashmir is in the northern part of India. In the eleventh century, the rulers were followers
of Saivism, and Saivism became the central religion in Kashmir. It was a closed kingdom.
Albiruni, the Arab traveller who visited India during this period remarked in his work,
Al-Hind that no one, not even Hindus from outside was allowed access to Kashmir. In
1320s, the ruling dynasty of Kashmir could not check the devastating Mongol invasions. It
therefore, lost all public support. In 1339, Shamsuddin Shah deposed the Saiva ruler and
became the ruler of Kashmir. From this period onwards, Islam influenced the Kashmiri
society. A group of Sufi saints known as the Rishis propagated a religion that combined
features of Hinduism and Islam Sufi saints and refugees migrated from Central Asia to
Kashmir and further influenced the society and religion. Gradually, the poorer section of
the population started converting to Islam. The state encouragement to Islam took place
when the Kashmiri Sultan, Sikandar Shah (1389–1413), issued an order that all Hindus
especially, the brahmanas living in his kingdom should embrace Islam or leave his king-
dom. It is said that these orders were issued at the instance of the king’s minister, Suha
Bhatt who was a Hindu and had recently converted to Islam.
Perhaps, one of the greatest rulers of Kashmir was Zainul Abidin (1420–1470). He was an
enlightened ruler and called back those Hindus who had left the state due to the persecution
of Sikandar Shah. He abolished jaziya and prohibited cow slaughter and gave the Hindus
important state posts. A large number of temples were repaired and new ones constructed.
Abul Fazl, the court historian of the Mughal Emperor Akbar noted that Kashmir had one
hundred and fifty big temples. Sultan Zainul Abidin married the daughters of the Hindu raja of
Jammu. Some scholars call Zainul Abidin as the Akbar of Kashmir. Under him, Kashmir
became prosperous and he was called the Bud Shah or the great king of Kashmiris.
The Sultan contributed to the agricultural development of Kashmir by constructing
dams and canals. Agricultural records were maintained. During the period of famine
and other natural calamities, relief in terms of loans and grains and fodder was pro-
vided to the peasants. Sultan also introduced reforms in the currency. He introduced
market control and fixed prices of the commodities. Traders and merchants were
asked to sell the commodities at fixed prices. Sultan also subsidized the import of the
commodities which were scarce in the state. To make up for the shortage of salt, he
imported salt from Ladakh and helped the traders in every possible way. Sultan also
paid attention to the development of handicrafts. He sent some people to"

Samarqand for training of paper making and book binding. Sultan also encouraged
stone cutting and polishing and many other crafts. He introduced carpet and shawl
making, which make Kashmir famous till day. Sultan also founded the towns of Zaingir,
Zainket and Zainpur and laid out the islands on the Dal Lake that can be seen till
today. His chief engineering achievement was the Zaina Lanka, an artificial island in
the Woolur Lake on which he built his palace and mosque.
He was a great scholar of Persian, Sanskrit, Tibetan and Arab languages and patronised
the Sanskrit and Persian scholars. Under his patronage, the Mahabharat and Kalhana’s
Rajatarangini were translated into Persian and many Persian and Arabic works were
translated into Hindi. He himself was a poet and wrote poetry under the pen name ‘Qutb’.
After him weak rulers ascended the throne of Kashmir and there was confusion.
Taking advantage of this, Mirza Haider, Babur’s relative occupied Kashmir. In 1586,
Akbar conquered Kashmir and made it a part of the Mughal Empire.
11.5 BENGAL
Bengal was an important regional kingdom under the Palas in the eighth century and
the Senas in the twelfth century. Bengal was the easternmost province of the Delhi
Sultanate. The long distance, uncomfortable climate and poor means of transport and
communications made it difficult for the Delhi Sultanate to control this province. There-
fore, it was easy for Bengal to assert its independence. Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq tried to
solve the problem by partitioning Bengal into three independent administrative divi-
sions: Lakhnauti, Satgaon and Sonargaon. However, the problems remained and fi-
nally Bengal emerged as an independent regional state in the fourteenth century.
In 1342, one of the nobles, Haji Ilyas Khan united Bengal and became its ruler under
the title of Shamsh-ud-din Iliyas Shah and laid the foundation of the Ilyas Shah dy-
nasty. He tried to annex Bengal and raided Orissa and Tirhut and forced them to pay
tribute. Such expansions alarmed the rulers of the Delhi Sultanate, who tried to oc-
cupy Bengal several times but were not successful. One of the important rulers of the
Ilyas Shah dynasty was Ghiyasuddin Azam. He was a learned man and promoted
Persian literature. He was well known for dispensing free and fair justice to people. It
is said that once he killed a son of a widow by accident. The widow filed a complaint
with Qazi who summoned the ruler to the court. When the case was decided, Azam
told the Qazi that had he not discharged his duties honestly he would have killed him.
Azam had cordial relations with China. There was a prosperous trading relationship
between Bengal and China. The port of Chittagaong was an important centre for
exchange of goods. On demand from the king of China, Azam also sent Buddhist
monks from Bengal. Pandua and Gaur were the capitals of Bengal.
In 1538, Bengal was annexed by Sher Shah Suri. In 1586, Akbar conquered Bengal, and
made it into a suba. While Persian was the language of administration, Bengali devel-
oped as a regional language. The establishment of Mughal control over Bengal coin-
cided with the rise of agrarian settlements in the forested and marshy areas of south-
eastern Bengal. Soon after, with the spread of rice cultivation, this area became heavily
populated with the local communities of fisher folks and peasants. The Mughals estab-
lished their capital in the heart of the eastern delta at Dhaka. Officials and functionaries
received land grants and settled there. Alauddin Hussain Shah (1439 to 1519) was
another important ruler of Bengal. He was very efficient, and gave high administrative
posts to the Hindus and is said to have paid respect to Chaitanya of the Vaisnava sect.
He came into conflict with Sikandar Lodhi and had to make peace with him."

11.6 GUJARAT
This was a fertile and prosperous province. It had flourishing seaports and was fa-
mous for its handicrafts. Alauddin Khalji was the first Sultan to annex it to Delhi
Sultanate and since then it remained under the Turkish governors of the Sultanate.
After Timur’s invasion, in 1407, Zafar Khan who was then the governor became the
independent ruler and after sometime assumed the title of Muzaffar Shah. Zafar
Khan’s father was a Rajput who had given his sister in marriage to Feroz Shah Tughlaq.
Ahmad Shah (1411–1441), was one of the important rulers of Gujarat. He founded the
city of Ahmadabad and made it his capital in 1413. He built beautiful buildings, like Jama
Masjid and Teen Darwaza and beautified the city with gardens, palaces and bazaars.
Ahmad Shah was influenced by the Jaina architectural traditions of Gujarat. He was an
efficient administrator and consolidated the regional state of Gujarat. He subdued the
Rajput states, Jhalawar, Bundi and Durgapur. He was supposed to be an orthodox
Muslim who imposed jaziya on the Hindus and destroyed several temples. However,
the picture was complex. At the same time, he appointed Hindus to important adminis-
trative positions. Ahmad Shah fought equally fiercely against the Hindu as well as the
Muslim rulers. His main enemy were the Muslim rulers of Malwa. The rivalry between
Gujarat and Malwa was bitter and prevented both the regional states from concentrat-
ing on larger political gains in north Indian politics. He was famous for imparting justice.
He publicly executed his son-in-law who had murdered an innocent. The author of
Mirat-i-Ahmadi has rightly said that the impact of this justice lasted till his reign.
Perhaps the most important ruler of Gujarat was Mahmud Begarha. He was called
Mahmud Begarha as he had captured two powerful forts or garh, Girnar (Junagarh)
in Saurashtra and the fort of Champaner from the Rajputs in south Gujarat. Both
these forts were of strategic importance. The fort of Girnar was in the prosperous
Saurahstra region and also provided a base for operations against Sindh. The Sultan
founded a new town called Mustafabad at the foot of the hill. This town with many
beautiful monuments became the second capital of Gujarat. Similarly, the fort of
Champaner was crucial to control Malwa and Khandesh. Mahmud constructed a
new town called Muhammadabad near Champaner.
According to another version, he was called Begarha as his moustaches resembled the
horns of a cow (begarha). Mahmud is supposed to have had a flowing beard which
reached up to his waist. His moustache was supposed to be so long that he tied it over his
head. According to a foreign traveller, Duarto Barbosa, right from his childhood, Mahmud
was given some poison as his food which made him so poisonous that if a fly settled on his
head, it would meet instant death. Mahmud was also famous for huge appetite. It is said
that for breakfast he ate a cup of honey, a cup of butter and one hundred to hundred and
fifty banananas. In total, he consumed ten to fifteen kilos of food everyday. Mahmud
Begarha ruled for 52 years. He was also a great patron of art and literature. Many
works were translated from Arabic to Persian in his court. His court poet was
Udayaraja, who composed poetry in Sanskrit.
In 1507, Mahmud led an expedition against the Portuguese who had settled on the west-
ern coast and monopolised the trade there, causing immense harm to the Muslim traders.
To break the Portuguese trade monopoly he sought the help of the Sultan of Turkey
but could not get much headway and finally had to give the Portuguese a site for a
factory in Diu. He died in 1511. During the rule of his successors Akbar conquered
and annexed Gujarat in 1572 AD."

11.7 THE BAHAMANI SULTANATE
In the fourteenth century two powerful kingdoms arose in South India. One was the
Bahamani Sultanate and the second kingdom was the Vijayanagar Empire that ruled
for 300 years. In this section we will discuss the history of Bahamani Sultanate and its
administrative features.
The Deccan region was a part of the provincial administration of the Delhi Sultanate.
In order to establish a stable administration in the Deccan, Mohammad bin Tughlaq
appointed amiran-i-sada/ Sada Amir, who were the administrative heads of hundred
villages. From 1337 the conflict between the officers in Deccan and Delhi sultanate
acclerated. This led to the establishment of an independent state in the Deccan in
1347 with the capital at Gulbarga in Andhra Pradesh. Its founders Haran Kangu
assumed the title Alauddin Hasan Bahman Shah as he traced his descent from the
mythical hero of Iran, Bahman Shah and the kingdom was named after him, the
Bahamani Sultanate. After Mohammad bin Tughlaq there were no attempts by the
Delhi Sultanate to control the Deccan region. Therefore, the Bahamani Sultans with-
out any checks annexed the kingdom. One of the important acquisitions was the
control over Dabhol, an important port on the west coast.
Under Bahman Shah and his son Muhammmad Shah, the administrative system
was well organised. The kingdom was divided into four administrative units called
‘taraf’ or provinces. These provinces were Daultabad, Bidar, Berar and Gulbarga.
Muhammad I defeated the Vijayanagar kingdom and consequently Golconda was
annexed to Bahamani kingdom. Every province was under a tarafdar  who was
also called a subedar . Some land was converted into Khalisa  land from the
jurisdiction of the tarafdar . Khalisa land was that piece of land which was used
to run expenses of the king and the royal household. Further the services and the
salary of every noble was fixed. Those nobles who kept 500 horses were given
1000,000 huns annually. If short of the stipulated troops, the tarafdar  would
have to reimburse the amount to the central government. Nobles used to get their
salary either in cash or in form of grant of land or ‘jagir’ Bahamani ruler de-
pended for military support on his amirs. There were two groups in the ranks of
amirs: One was the Deccanis who were immigrant Muslims and had been stay-
ing for a long time in the Deccan region. The other group was Afaquis or Pardesis
who had recently come from Central Asia, Iran and Iraq and had settled in the"

Deccan region recently. Between both these groups there was always tension to
appropriate better administrative positions. Because of their feuds, the stability
of the Bahamani Sultanate was affected. For the first time in India both these
kingdoms used gunpowder in the warfare. The Bahamanis were already familiar
with the use of firearms. They employed Turkish and Portuguese experts to train
the soldiers in the latest weaponry of warfare.
One of the most important personalities in the Bahamani kingdom was Mahmud Gawan.
Mahmud Gawan’s early life is obscure. He was an Iranian by birth and first reached
Deccan as a trader. He was granted the title of ‘Chief of the Merchants’ or Malik-
ut-Tujjar by the Bahamani ruler, Humayun Shah. The sudden death of Humayun led
to the coronation of his minor son Ahmad III. A regency council was set for the
administration and Mahmud Gawan was its important member. He was made wazir
or the prime minister and was given the title of ‘Khwaju-i-Jahan.’ The history of
Bahmani kingdom after this period is actually the record of the achievements of
Mahmud Gawan. Despite of being an Afaqui he was liberal and wanted a compro-
mise between the Afaquis and the Deccanis. He controlled the kingdom in an effi-
cient manner and provided it stability. Gawan conquered the Vijayanagar territories
up to Kanchi. On the western coast, Goa and Dhabol were conquered. Losing these
important ports was a great loss for Vijayanagar. Bahamani strengthened its trading
relations with Iran and Iraq after gaining control over Goa and Dabhol.
Gawan carried out many internal reforms and attempted to put an end to the strife in
the nobility. In order to curb the military power of the tarafdar, Gawan ordered that
only one fort of each province was to be under the direct control of the provincial
tarafdar. The remaining forts of the province were placed under a Qiladar or com-
mander of the forts. The Qiladar was appointed by the central Government. How-
ever, soon after his death, the governors declared their independence and the Bahamani
kingdom broke up. In the fifteenth and the sixteenth century, some amirs in Bidar,
Ahmadnagar, Golconda and Bijapur and Berar established independent sultanates of
their own and formed new states. These were the Nizam Shahis of Ahmadnagar, the
Adil Shahis of Bijapur, the Qutb Shahis of Golconda, and the Imad Shahis of Berar
and the Barid Shahis of Bidar. They formed a league of states and strengthened them
by matrimonial alliances. They maintained the traditional rivalry with the Vijayanagar
rulers. Golconda and Bijapur entered into matrimonial alliances and led the Battle of
Talikota against Vijayanagar. They finally succumbed to the Mughal armies.

capital city Vijayanagar on the banks of river Tungabhadra in 1336. Their dynasty was
called the Sangama dynasty. There are several theories with regard to the origin of this
dynasty. According to some scholars, they had been the feudatories of the Kakatiyas of
Warangal and after their fall they served the Kampili state. Another view says that they
were the feudatories of the Hoysalas and belonged to Karnataka. Harihara and Bukka
were helped and inspired by contemporary scholar and a saint Vidyaranya for the establish-
ment of their kingdom. It is believed that to commemorate the memory of their guru, the
brothers established the city of Vidyanagar or Vijayanagara on the banks of river Tungabhadra.
The empire included people from different cultural regions, the Tamil, Telegu and Karnataka
region who all spoke different languages and belonged to different cultures.
Between 1336 and 1565, Vijayanagar was ruled by three different dynasties- Sangama,
who remained in power till 1485; the Saluva who remained in power till 1503 and the
Tuluvas. The last dynasty was the Aravidu dynasty that ruled till seventeenth century.
Foreign travellers like Nicolo Conti, Fernao Nuniz ,Domingo Paes, Duarto Barbosa
and Abdur Razzaq wrote about the magnificence of Vijayanagar.
One of the most important rulers of the Vijayanagar states was Krishnadevaraya, the
founder of the Tuluva dynasty. He was a great commander and an efficient adminis-
trator. He fought a series of war with the independent kingdoms that came on the
ruins of the Bahamani kingdom, maintained law and order and dealt with the Portu-
guese influence in the Deccan. He completely shattered the Adil Shahi forces of
Bijapur first and attacked Gulbarga and set free three Bahamani princes who were
imprisoned there. He helped them in recovering the throne of Gulbarga and Krishna
Deva himself took the title of Yavanarajya sthapanacharya.
Krishnadevaraya built some fine stone temples and added impressive gopurams or gate-
ways to many important South Indian temples. He also founded a suburban township near
Vijayanagara called Nagalapuram after his mother. Some of the most detailed descrip-
tions of Vijayanagar come from his period. The famous temple of Tirupati developed
during his period greatly as the deity there was his titular deity. After Krishna Deva Raya,
his brother Achyuta Deva Raya ascended the throne in 1530 AD, who was also an
important ruler. During his reign the rival groups began to make his appearance. The
struggle for power was mainly between Saluva Vira Narasimha and Aravidu Rama Raya,
in which the later emerged victorious. Although Rama Raya did not assume the throne,
yet he placed Sadasiva Raya on the throne and ruled as the defacto ruler. He removed the
old nobility and replaced it with those loyal to him. Rama Raya tried to balance the Deccan
powers by playing one against the other, such a policy could not continue for a long period.
The Deccan states formed a confederacy and inflicted a crushing blow on the Vijayanagar
armies in the battle of Talikota. Rama Raya was killed. The Deccani armies entered
Vijayanagar and reduced in into ruins. Now the focus shifted to the east where the Aravidu
dynasty ruled from Penukonda and later from Chandragiri (near Tirupati).
Army and Military Organisation Of The Vijayanagar Empire
In order to wage continuous warfare there was a need to keep a large army. Artillery
was important and well bred horses were maintained. The Vijayanagar rulers im-
ported high quality horses from across the Arabian Sea from Arabia and other Gulf
countries. The port of Malabar was the centre of this trade and trade in other luxury
commodities. The Vijayanagar rulers always attempted to control the port of Malabar.
Like the Bahamanis, the Vijayanagar state also was familiar with the use of firearms
and employed Turkish and Portuguese experts to train the soldiers in the latest
weaponry of warfare. One of the rayas, Deva Raya II enrolled Muslims in his armed"

services, allotted them jagirs and erected a mosque for their use in the city. Such
new techniques in warfare now revolutionised the warfare. The walls of the forts to
counter the firearms were now made thick and special kinds of door with fortified
walls front were constructed. On the walls of the forts, special kinds of big holes
were made to rest the guns. Special kinds of parapets were constructed on the forts
to put the canons on it. Firearms were used. Some firearms were small and com-
prised of rifles and pistols. Some like canons were heavy and had to be put on a
bullock cart or on an elephant and pushed into the battlefield.
One of the important characteristics of the Vijayanagar administration was the amara-
nayaka system. In this system, the commander of the Vijayanagar army was called
the nayaka. Each nayaka was given an area for administration. The nayaka was
responsible for expanding agricultural activities in his area. He collected taxes in his
area and with this income maintained his army, horses, elephants and weapons of
warfare that he had to supply to the raya or the Vijayanagar ruler. The nayaka was
also the commander of the forts. Some of the revenue was also used for the mainte-
nance of temples and irrigation works. The amara-nayakas sent tribute to the king
annually and personally appeared in the royal court with gifts to express their loyalty.
In the seventeenth century, several of these nayakas became independent and estab-
lished separate states. The feudal Nayankaras used to maintain their own soldiers,
forces and elephants. They were a powerful section that challenged the Vijayanagar
authority, weakened its Internal structures and contributed to the defeat of the
Vijayangar in the battle of Talikota.
11.8.2 CONFLICT BETWEEN THE VIJAYANAGAR
AND THE BAHAMANIS
There were constant conflicts between the Vijayanagar and the Bahamani king-
doms over the control of Raichur doab which was the land between rivers Krishna
and Tungabhadra. This area was fertile and rich in mineral resources. The famous
diamond mines of Golconda were located in the eastern part of the doab region.
The geography of both the kingdoms was such that expansion was possible only
across Tungabhadra in the Deccan. It appears that the battles between the two
were not conclusive and the status quo  was maintained. Sometimes, Bahamani
had an advantage and sometimes, Vijayanagar had an advantage. For instance, in
1504, the Bahamani managed to reconquer the Raichur doab. However, with the
ascent of Krishna Deva Raya, the Bahamanis lost Raichur, Mudkal, Nalgonda and
other inland towns. An important result of these wars was that both the powers
were so involved amongst themselves that they never realised the increasing power
of the Portuguese on the coast of South India. Besides, continuous warfare ex-
hausted the resources of both the states and weakened them.
The other areas of conflict were the Marathwada region and the deltaic region of
Krishna-Godavari. Both regions had fertile areas and important ports that controlled
trade to the foreign countries. For instance, the fertile area in the Marathwada region
was the Konkan belt that also had the port of Goa which was an important region for
trade and export and import especially import of horses from Iraq and Iran.
Often, the battles between the Vijayanagar and the Bahamani states are perceived as
Hindu-Muslim conflicts. The above reasons show that the struggle was not due to
any religious differences. Territorial and economic motives were the main causes for
the war. Despite hostilities between the two states, there were times when they also
co-operated with each other. Krishnadevaraya, for example, supported some claim-"

11.8 REGIONAL STATES IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
You must have studied about the crisis in the Mughal Empire in the eighteenth century
that finally led to the collapse of the Mughal Empire. As the Mughal authority weak-
ened, the governors of the provinces, subedars, and the big zamindars became pow-
erful and asserted their independence.
The regional states of this period can be divided into three categories:
1. There were some states whose founders were important Mughal nobles and held
high mansabs. Though they became independent, they never broke fromal ties
with the Mughal state. Some of the important states in this category are Awadh,
Bengal and Hyderabad. The founder of the Awadh state was Sa’adat Khan. The
founder of Bengal was Mushid Quli Khan and the founder of Hyderabad state
was Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah. All three were powerful members of the Mughal
nobility and were the governors of these provinces. As the Mughal Empire weak-
ened, there was a large-scale migration of soldiers and administrators from Delhi
to these new states that promised numerous opportunities.
In these states the position of the previous zamindars changed. For example,
Sa’adat Khan seized a number of Rajput zamindaris and the agriculturally fer-
tile lands of the Afghans at Rohilkhand. Similarly, in an effort to reduce Mughal
influence in Bengal, Mushid Quli Khan transferred all Mughal jagirdars to Orissa
and ordered a major reassessment of the revenues of Bengal. Revenue was
collected in cash with great strictness from all zamindars. As a result, many
zamindars had to borrow money from bankers and moneylenders. Those un-
able to pay were forced to sell their lands to larger zamindars.
Another change in these states was the rise of the bankers and moneylend-
ers or mahajans . The state and the landed class depended on them for
loans. These bankers in turn became powerful and influenced the adminis-
tration. The state auctioned its right to collect taxes to the highest bidders,
who were usually bankers and mahajans . In turn, the bankers promised to"

pay a fixed sum of money to the state. Thus, the state was assured of a fixed
income. This system was called the  ijaradari system and those who bought
the right to collect taxes were known as ijaredars.  The Mughal state had
always discouraged this system. There were chances that those who col-
lected the tax would collect much more than fixed, exploiting the peasants
and would give less to the state thereby causing a loss to the state revenue.
2. The second category of regional states in the eighteenth century was those states
that had already enjoyed a lot of independence during the Mughal rule as watan
jagirs. The Rajput states belonged to this category.
3. The third category of regional states was those that had emerged after rebelling
against the Mughal authority. The Sikhs, the Marathas and the Jats belonged to
this group. For example, the Sikh rebellion against the Mughals led to state-
building in the Punjab.

1. Regional States in 18 th century have been divided into which categories?
WHAT YOU HA VE LEARNT
The rise of regional states from the thirteenth to the eighteenth century is due to
internal weakness of Delhi Sultanate and decline of Mughal Empire. An under-
standing of the nature of these regional powers will help you see the Delhi sul-
tanate and Mughal Empire in a clear perspective. It will be useful if the regional
states of this period are seen in continuation with the regional states from sixth to
the twelfth century also. To understand the regional states, one has to first un-
derstand the concept of regionalism, which has political features, language, reli-
gious affiliations, Art & Culture as developed and evolved over a period of time
as discussed in this lesson. There were a large number of such states but we
have taken only a few as case studies. Jaunpur, Kashmir, Gujarat, Bengal,
Vijayanagr and Bahamani were discussed. It should be remembered that though
these states fought with each other, but they also borrowed ideas in the field of
art, architecture and religion from each other. Their relationship with the central
authority as well as among themselves kept changing from time to time.

ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM AND
INSTITUTIONS
12
Notes
With the establishment of the Delhi sultanate a new ruling class emerged in India.
This new class introduced a new administrative system. Some new institutions were
also introduced. After the coming of the Mughals some of these underwent changes
and a few new ones got introduced. A few of the administrative institution had their
roots in Arab and Central Asia from where the new ruling group came. While some
others were of Indian origin. A significant feature of these was that many of these got
transformed and in due course of time developed as suitable to Indian context.
The new administrative system and institutions contributed in the consolidation of the
Sultanate and Mughal empire. It would not be possible for us to discuss all aspects of
administration over a period of 500 years in a small lesson. However we will try to
provide the basic features, continuity and changes in the administrative structure and
some important institutions.
The ruling class kept changing during this period. These institutions were used by various
rulers for other purposes also. The rulers from time to time included people from various
social classes in the administrative apparatus in order to have social harmony. It was
natural on the part of these social classes to stake a claim in the system of governance
and various rulers readily accommodated them in this system. In this sense these institu-
tions also emerged as a tool to contain any kind of social conflict in the society, though
there were various other measures also that were used by the rulers for this purpose.
OBJECTIVES

 Administrative System and Institutions
12.1 EVOLUTION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE
UNDER DELHI SULTANATE
When Qutubuddin Aibak established himself as an independent Sultan at Lahore, the
available administrative apparatus was continued in the initial phase. The prevailing
structure was not altered or disturbed and as long, as the local rulers recognised the
supremacy of the Sultan in Delhi, they were allowed to collect taxes and send it to the
central treasury as tribute. The central officials in these areas were mainly to help
the local rulers in their administrative tasks. With the expansion and consolidation of the
Delhi Sultanate, new administrative institutions also started emerging. The administra-
tive structures and institutions introduced in India were influenced by the Mongols,
Seljukids etc, brought by the new rulers. The existing administrative institutions in dif-
ferent parts of the country also contributed in giving shape to the new system.
The Sultans were aware of the fact that they had to rule over a subject population
that was largely non-Islamic. Thus the Sultans of Delhi had to introduce particular mea-
sures to suit the prevailing conditions in the Sultanate. From the administrative point of
view, the local level administration, it seems, was left mainly in the hands of village head-
men etc. The large extent of the Sultanate necessitated the evolution of administrative
structure separately for the centre and provinces. Thus, during the Sultanate period, ad-
ministrative institutions emerged at different levels - central, provincial and local.
Let us now examine various components of the administrative system in detail.
12.2 ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM
During the Sultanate period the administrative apparatus was headed by the Sultan
who was helped by various nobles. There were various other offices along with the
office of the Sultan. Theoretically, there was a council of Ministers Majlis-i-Khalwat
to assist the Sultan.
(i) The Sultan
The Sultan was the central figure in the administrative set up. He was the head of the
civil administration and Supreme Commander of the army. He made all the appoint-
ments and promotions. He also had the right to remove anybody from the service. He
had absolute power in his hand. He was also the head of the Judiciary. He used to
confer titles and honours upon people. Theoretically the Sultan had an exalted position but
in actual practice different Sultans enjoyed varying power. The position of the Sultan was
always under pressure from the powerful group of nobility and Ulema. Sultans of Delhi,
particularly the powerful Sultans, adopted various strategies to keep these groups under
control. Balban kept the nobles firmly under his control. Thus the personality of the Sultan
played a significant role in the administrative structure of the Sultanate. Under the capable
and strong Sultans, the administration and the administrative structure functioned well but
under the inefficient and weak ruler the same was under pressure.
(ii) Nobility
The nobles were the most important functionaries of the state and enjoyed high social
status. In the initial stage they were those commanders who came with the victorious
army. Over a period of time their descendants formed the main strength and some Indian
groups also emerged. The position and power of the nobility varied from time to time as
has been mentioned above. Nobles, particularly those who were based at Delhi, emerged
as a very powerful group and at times even played a role in the selection of the sultan."

HISTORY
 Administrative System and Institutions
The nobility was not a homogeneous class. There were different groups within the nobility
and often there were inter group clashes and rivalries. The clash between Turkish and
Tajik nobles started during the time of Iltutmish and became intense after his death.
The group of chahalgan (group of 40 nobles), which was created by Iltutmish, also
emerged very powerful.
Balban was the first Sultan to bring the nobility firmly under his control (interestingly,
he had been a part of chalalgan earlier). Qutubuddin Aibak and Iltutmish had consid-
ered the nobles at par with themselves. Balban maintained distance from the nobility
and enforced strict code of conduct for himself and for the nobility. No loose talk or
laughter was allowed in the court. He also emphasized on high blood and made it a
criteria for occupying high positions and offices.
With the expansion of the Delhi Sultanate there were also attempts on the part of
different sections of the society to join the nobility. Initially it was the preserve of the
Turks only. During the rule of the Khalji and Tughlags the doors of the nobility were
opened to people of diverse backgrounds. The low caste people, both Hindus and
Muslims, joined the nobility and could rise to high positions especially under Muhammad
Bin Tughlaq. During the Lodi period the Afghan concept of equality became impor-
tant when the Sultan was considered “first among equals”. Thus the nobles enjoyed
equal status with the Sultan. Some of the Lodi Sultans like Sikandar Lodi and Ibrahim
Lodi found this uncomfortable and tried to bring the nobles under their control. The
nobles resisted this which resulted in the trouble for both the Sultans.
 (iii) Ulema
The religious intellectual group of Muslims was collectively referred as Ulema. People
of this group managed religious matters and interpreted religious regulations for Sul-
tan. They were also incharge of judicial matters and worked as Qazis at various
levels. It was quite influential group and commanded respect of Sultan and nobility.
They also had influence among Muslim masses. This group used to pressurize the
sultan to run the Sultanate as per the religious laws of Islam. The Sultan and nobles
generally tried to run the administrative affairs as per the need of state rather than
religious laws. Sultan like Alauddin Khalji could ignore the opinions of Ulema on a
number of issues but some followed their line.

 Administrative System and Institutions
12.3 CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION
As already mentioned the administrative system was headed by the Sultan. There
were a number of departments which were assigned different responsibilities. These
departments were managed by influential nobles. We will provide a brief account of a
few departments.
(i) Wizarat
After Sultan, the most important office was the Diwan-i-Wizarat, headed by the
wazir. It was a key position in the royal court and his role was of a general supervisor
over all departments, though he was one of the four important departmental heads.
He was the chief advisor to the Sultan. The main functions of the wazir were to look
after the financial organization of the State, give advice to the Sultan, and on occa-
sions to lead military expeditions at Sultan’s behest. He also supervised the payment
to the army. The wizarat or the office of wazir also kept a check on land revenue
collections, maintained a record of all the income and expenditure incurred by the
state and thus controlled or recorded the salaries of all royal servants, handled the
charitable donations such as Waqfs, Inams etc. Further, the Mints, the intelligence
departments, the royal buildings and other bodies affiliated to the royal court were
supervised by the wizarat. The wazir had direct access to the Sultan and it was on his
wisdom, sincerity and loyalty that the position of the Sultan depended greatly.
There were several other departments which worked under the wizarat. They were
entrusted with specific functions. These included Mustaufi-i-Mumalik (Auditor Gen-
eral), Mushrif-i-Mumalik (Accountant General), Majmuadar (Keeper of loans and
balances from treasury). Later some other offices were brought under the supervi-
sion of the Wizarat like Diwan-i -Waqoof (to supervise expenditure), Diwan-i-
Mustakharaj (to look into the arrears of revenue payments), Diwan-i-Amir Kohi (to
bring uncultivated land into cultivation through state support).
(ii) Diwan-i-Arz
This department was set up to look after the military organization of the empire. It was
headed by Ariz-i-Mumalik. He was responsible for the administration of military af-
fairs. He maintained royal contingent, recruited the soldiers, ensured the discipline and
fitness of the army, inspected the troops maintained by the Iqta-holders, examined the
horses and branded them with the royal insignia. During times of war, the ariz arranged
military provisions, transportation and administered the army at war, provided constant
supplies and was the custodian of the war booty. Alauddin Khalji introduced the system
of Dagh (branding) and huliya (description) and cash payment to the soldiers in order
to strengthen his control over the army. The contingent stationed at Delhi was called
hasham-i-qalb and Provincial contingents were called hasham-i-atraf.
(iii) Diwan-i-Insha
This department looked after the state correspondence. It was headed by Dabir-i-
Khas. He drafted and despatched royal orders and received reports from various
officers. The Dabir was the formal channel of communication between the centre
and other regions of the empire. He was also a sort of private secretary of the Sultan
and was responsible for writing the farmans.
The Barid-i-Mumalik was the head of the state news gathering and dealt with intel-
ligence. He had to keep information of all that was happening in the Sultanate. At
local level there were barids who used to send regular news concerning the matters"

of the state to the central office. Apart from barids, another set of reporters also
existed who were known as Munihiyan.
(iv) Diwan-i-Rasalat
This department dealt with the administration of Justice. It was headed by Sadr-us-
Sadr who was also the qazi-i-mumalik. He was the highest religious officer and took
care of ecclesiastical affairs. He also appointed the qazis (judges) and approved
various charitable grants like waqf, wazifa, Idrar, etc.
The Sultan was the highest court of appeal in both civil and criminal matters. Next to
him was Qazi-i-mumalik. The Muhtasibs (Public Censors) assisted the judicial de-
partment. Their main task was to see that there was no public infringement of the
tenets of Islam. He was also to supervise and enforce the public morals and conduct.
(v) Other Departments
Apart from these, there were a number of smaller departments at the centre which
helped in the everyday administration of the empire. Wakil-i-dar looked after the
royal household and managed the personal services of the Sultan. Amir-i-Hajib looked
after the royal ceremonies. He used to act as an intermediary between the Sultan and
subordinate officials and between Sultan and the public. Sar-i-Jandar looked after
the royal body guards. Amir-i-Akhur looked after the establishment of horses and
Shahnah-i-fil looked after the establishment of elephants. Amir-i-Majlis looked af-
ter the arrangement of meetings and special ceremonies. The Royal workshops
(Karkhanas) played an important role in the administrative system of the Sultanate.
The needs of the royal house hold were met through Karkhanas. The Karkhanas were
of two types - (i) Manufactories (ii) Store House. Under Feroz Tughlaq, there were as
many as 36 Karkhanas. Each Karkhana was supervised by a noble who had the rank
of a Malik or a Khan. The Mutasarrif was responsible for the accounts and acted as
immediate supervisors in various departments.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 12.2
1. Mention two departments that worked under the Wizarat.
2. What practices did Alauddin Khalji introduce in the army?
3. Which department dealt with the administration of Justice and who headed it?
12.4 PROVINCIAL ADMINISTRATION AND IQTA SYSTEM
The administration in the areas that were outside the core political area was carried
out in a number of ways. It depended on the degree of political control which was
exercised over the areas. The territorial expansion and consolidation of the sultanate
was a process which continued throughout the 13th and 14th centuries. Some of the
newly conquered areas were brought directly under the control of the Sultanate and
some other areas remained semi autonomous. Thus different Control mechanisms
were adopted by the Sultan for these areas. In the areas that were loosely affiliated to
the Sultanate, a few officials were appointed by the Centre as a symbol of imperial
presence but everyday administration remained in local hands. The interest of the
centre in these areas was mostly economic, i.e. the collection of the revenue."

Notes
 Administrative System and Institutions
The provinces were placed under the charge of the Governors who were respon-
sible for the overall administration of the area. This involved ensuring the collection
of revenue, maintaining law and order and keeping rebellious elements under con-
trol. He was a deputy of the Sultan in his area. Since the officials were frequently
transferred and not familiar with the areas, they were generally dependent on local
officials to perform their duties. The collection of the revenue was not possible
without the help of the local officials. Thus the governor and the local power blocs
worked in close association with each other. At times the combination created prob-
lems for the Sultan as the governors used to become powerful with the help provided
by the local rulers and rise in rebellion against the Sultan. During the 14th century the
provinces were partitioned into Shiqs for administrative convenience. The shiqs
were administered by the Shiqdar. Subsequently the Shiqs got transformed into
Sarkar during the Afghan period. Faujdar was another officer along with Shiqdar
at the provincial level. Their duties are not clearly articulated, and often the role of
the two seem to overlap. The Shiqdar assisted the governor in the maintenance of
law and order and provided military assistance. He also supervised the functioning
of the smaller administrative units. The duties of the Faujdar were similar to the
Shiqdar. The Kotwals were placed under the Faujdar.
The other important officers at the provincial level were Barids (intelligence officer
and reporter) and Sahib-i-Diwan (who maintained the financial accounts of the
provincial income and expenditure).
12.5 IQTA SYSTEM
The institution of the Iqta  had been in force in early Islamic world as a form of
reward for services to the state. In the caliphate administration it was used to pay
civil and military officers. After the establishment of the Sultanate iqta system was
introduced by the Sultans. To begin with the army commanders and nobles were
given territories to administer and collect the revenue. The territories thus assigned
were called iqta and their holders as iqtadar or muqti.
In essence this was a system of payment to the officers and maintenance of army by
them. Gradually rules and regulations were laid down to organize the whole system.
Through the years it became the main instrument of administrating the Sultanate.
Further the sultans could get a large share of the surplus production from different
parts of the vast territories through this system.
From the 14th century we hear of Walis or muqtis who are commanders of military
and administrative tracts called Iqta. Their exact powers varied according to circum-
stances. In due course the muqti was given complete charge of the administration of
the iqta which included the task of maintaining an army. The muqti was to help the
sultan with his army in case of need. He was expected to  maintain the army and
meet his own expenses with the revenue collected. From the time of Balban the
muqti was expected to send the balance (fawazil) of the income to the centre after
meeting his and the army’s expenses. This means that the central revenue depart-
ment had made an assessment of the expected income of the Iqta, the cost of the
maintenance of the army and the muqti’s own expenses. This process became even
more strict during the time of Alauddhin Khalji. As the central control grew, the
control over muqti’s administration also increased. The Khwaja (probably same as
Sahib-i-Diwan) was appointed to keep a record of the income of the Iqtas. It was
on the basis of this record that the Sultan used to make his revenue demands. A barid"

or intelligence officer was also appointed to keep the Sultan informed. During the reign
of Muhmmad-bin-Thughlaq a number of governors were appointed on revenue sharing
terms where they were to give a fixed sum to the state. During the time of Feroze Shah
Tughlaq the control of state over iqtas was diluted when iqtas became hereditary.
12.6 LOCAL ADMINISTRATION
The village was the smallest unit of administration. The functioning and administration of
the village remained more or less the same as it had existed in pre Turkish times. The main
village functionaries were khut, Muqaddam and Patwari. They worked in close coordi-
nation with the muqti in the collection of revenue and in maintaining law and order etc. A
number of villages formed the Pargana. The important Pargana officials were Chaudhary,
Amil (revenue collector) and Karkun (accountant). Village and pargana were indepen-
dent units of administration, and yet there were inter related areas. In certain cases the
province had a local ruler (Rai, Rana, Rawat, Raja) who helped the governor in his
duties. In such cases the local rulers were recognised as subordinates of the Sultan.

12.7 MARKET REFORMS OF ALAUDDIN KHALJI
The market reforms of Alauddin Khalji were oriented towards administrative and military
necessities. Medieval rulers believed that necessities of life, especially food grains, should
be available to the city folk at reasonable prices. But few rulers had been able to control
the prices for any length of time. Alauddin Khalji was more or less the first ruler who
looked at the problem of price control, in a systematic manner and was able to maintain
stable prices for a considerable period. It has been pointed out that Alauddin Khalji insti-
tuted the market control because after the mongol seige of Delhi, he wanted to recruit a
large army. All his treasures would have soon exhausted if he was to spend huge re-
sources on army. With low prices the sultan could recruit a large army with low expenses.
Whatever may be the reason for the market reforms, elaborate administrative arrange-
ments were made to ensure that the market control was followed strictly.
Alauddin fixed the prices of all commodities from grain to cloth, slaves, cattles
etc. He also set up three markets at Delhi, the first for food grains, the second
for cloth of all kinds and for expensive items such as sugar, ghee, oil, dry fruits
etc. and the third for the horses, slaves and cattle. For controlling the food prices,
Alauddin tried to control not only the supply of food grains from the villages, and
its transportation to the city by the grain merchants, but also its proper distribu-
tion to the citizens. A number of measures were taken to see that prices laid"

down by the Sultan were strictly observed. An officer (Shehna) was in charge
of the market to see that no one violates the royal orders. Barids (intelligence
officers ) and munhiyan (secret spies) were also appointed. Alauddin also tried
to ensure that there were sufficient stocks of food-grains with the government
so that the traders did not hike up prices by creating an artificial scarcity, or
indulge in profiterring. Granaries were set up in Delhi and Chhain (Rajasthan).
The Banjaras or Karwaniyan who transported the food grains from the country
side to the city were asked to form themselves in a body. They were to settle on
the banks of Yamuna with their families. An official (Shehna) was appointed to
oversee them. To ensure the regular supply of food grains to the Banjaras, a
number of regulations were made. All the food grains were to be brought to the
market (mandis) and sold only at official prices.
The second market for cloth, dry fruits, ghee etc. was called Sarai-i-  adl. All the
clothes brought from different parts of the country and also from outside were to
be stored and sold only in this market at government rates. To ensure an ad-
equate supply of all the commodities, all the merchants were registered and a
deed taken from them that they would bring the specified quantities of commodi-
ties to the Sarai-i-adl every year. The Merchants who, brought commodities
from long distances including foreign countries were given advance money on
the condition that they would not sell to any intermediaries. In cases of costly
commodities an officer was to issue permits to amirs, maliks etc. for the pur-
chase of these expensive commodities in accordance with their income. This
was done to prevent any black marketing of these expensive products.
The third market dealt with horses, cattle and slaves. The supply of horses of good
quality at fair prices was important for the army. Alauddin did away with the middle-
man or dallal who had become very powerful. It was decided that the government
fixed the Quality and prices of the horses. Similarly, the prices of slave boys and girls
and of cattle were also fixed. But these reforms didn’t last long and after the death of
Alauddin these reforms got lost.

12.8 ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE UNDER THE MUGHALS
The Mughals retained many features of the administrative system of the Sultanate
and Shershah. Under Shershah the administrative units of Pargana (a group of vil-
lages), sarkar (a group of parganas) and groups of sarkars (some what like subas or
province) were placed under specific offices. The Mughals formalized a new territo-
rial unit called suba. Institutions of Jagir and Mansab system were also introduced by
the Mughals. Thus change and continuity both marked the Mughal administrative
structure which brought about a high degree of centralisation in the system."

12.8.1 CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION
(i) The Emperor
The Emperor was the supreme head of the administration and controlled all military
and judicial powers. All officers in Mughal administration owed their power and posi-
tion to the Emperor. The Emperor had authority to appoint, promote, and remove
officials at his pleasure. There was no pressure institutional or otherwise on the Em-
peror. For smooth functioning of the empire a few departments were created.
(ii) Wakil and Wazir
The institution of Wizarat (or Wikalat since both were used interchangeably) was present
in some form during the Delhi Sultanate also. The position of Wazir had lost its pre-
eminent position during the period of Afghan rulers in the Delhi Sultanate. The posi-
tion of the wazir was revived under the Mughals. Babur’s and Humayun’s wazir
enjoyed great powers. The period during which Bairam Khan (1556–60) was regent
of Akbar, saw the rise of wakil-wazir with unlimited powers. Akbar in his determina-
tion to curb the powers of wazir later on took away the financial powers from him.
This was a big jolt to wazir’s power.
(iii) Diwan-i-Kul
Diwan-i Kul was the chief diwan. He was responsible for revenue and finances.
Akbar had strengthened the office of diwan by entrusting the revenue powers to the
diwan. The diwan used to inspect all transaction and payments in all departments and
supervised the provincial diwans. The entire revenue collection and expenditure of
the empire was under his charge. The diwans were to report about state finance to
the Emperor on daily basis.

(iv) Mir Bakshi
Mir Bakshi looked after all matters pertaining to the military administration. The
orders of appointment of mansabdars and their salary papers were endorsed and
passed by him. He kept a strict watch over proper maintenance of the sanctioned size
of armed contingents and war equipage by the mansabdars. The new entrants seek-
ing service were presented to the Emperor by the Mir Bakshi.
(v) Sadr-us Sudur
The Sadr-us Sudur was the head of the ecclesiastical department. His chief duty was to
protect the laws of the Shariat. The office of the Sadr used to distribute allowances and
stipends to the eligible persons and religious institutions. It made this office very lucrative
during the first twenty-five years of Akbar’s reign. The promulgation of Mahzar in 1580
restricted his authority. According to Mahzar Akbar’s view was to prevail in case of
conflicting views among religious scholars. This officer also regulated the matters of rev-
enue free grants given for religious and charitable purposes. Later several restrictions
were placed on the authority of the Sadr for award of revenue free grants also.
Muhtasibs (censors of public morals) were appointed to ensure the general obser-
vance of the rules of morality. He also used to examine weights and measures and
enforce fair prices etc.
(vi) Mir Saman
The Mir Saman was the officer in-charge of the royal Karkhanas. He was respon-
sible for all kinds of purchases and their storage for the royal household. He was also
to supervise the manufacturing of different articles for the use of royal household.
12.8.2 PROVINCIAL ADMINISTRATION
The Mughal empire was divided into twelve provinces or subas by Akbar. These
were Allhabad, Agra, Awadh, Ajmer, Ahmedabad, Bihar, Bengal, Delhi, Kabul, Lahore,
Malwa and Multan. Later on Ahmednagar, Bearar and Khandesh were added. With
the expansion of Mughal empire the number of provinces increased to twenty.
Each suba was placed under a Subedar or provincial governor who
was directly appointed by the Emperor. The subedar was head of the province and
responsible for maintenance of general law and order. He was to encourage agricul-
ture, trade and commerce and take steps to enhance the revenue of the state. He was
also to suppress rebellions and provide army for expeditions.
The head of the revenue department in the suba was the Diwan. He was appointed
by the Emperor and was an independent officer. He was to supervise the revenue
collection in the suba and maintain accounts of all expenditures. He was also ex-
pected to increase the area under cultivation. In many cases advance loans (taqavi)
were given to peasants through his office.
The Bakshi in the province performed the same functions as were performed by Mir
Bakshi at the centre. He was appointed by the imperial court at the recommenda-
tions of the Mir Bakshi. He was responsible for checking and inspecting the horses
and soldiers maintained by the mansabdars in the suba. He issued the paybills of both
the mansabdars and the soldiers. Often his office was combined with Waqainiqar. In
this capacity his duty was to inform the centre about the happenings in his province.
The representative of the central Sadr (Sadr-us sudur) at the provincial level was
called Sadr. He was responsible for the welfare of those who were engaged in reli-
gious activities and learning. He also looked after the judicial department and in that
capacity supervised the works of the Qazis."

There were some other officers also who were appointed at the provincial level.
Darogai-i-Dak was responsible for maintaining the communication channel. He used
to pass on letters to the court through the postal runners (Merwars). Waqainavis and
waqainigars were appointed to provide reports directly to the Emperor.
12.8.3 LOCAL ADMINISTRATION
The provinces or subas were divided into Sarkars. The Sarkars were divided into
Parganas. The village was the smallest unit of administration.
At the level of Sarkar, there were two important functionaries, the faujdar and the
Amalguzar. The Faujdar was appointed by the imperial order. Sometimes within a
Sarkar a number of Faujdars existed. At times, their jurisdiction spread over two
Sarkars even if these belonged to two different subas. Faujdari was an administra-
tive division whereas Sarkar was a territorial and revenue division. The primary duty
of the faujdar was to safeguard the life and property of the residents of the areas
under his Jurisdiction. He was to take care of law and order problem in his areas and
assist in the timely collection of revenue whenever force was required.
The amalguzar or amil was the revenue collector. His duty was to assess and super-
vise the revenue collection. He was expected to increase the land under cultivation
and induce the peasants to pay revenue willingly. He used to maintain all accounts
and send the daily receipt and expenditure report to the provincial Diwan.
At the level of Pragana, the Shiqdar was the executive officer. He assisted the amils
in the task of revenue collection. The amils looked after the revenue collection at the
Pargana level. The quanungo kept all the records of land in the pargana. The Kotwals
were appointed mainly in towns by the imperial government and were incharge of law
and order. He was to maintain a register for keeping records of people coming and
going out of the towns. The Muqaddam was the village head man and the Patwari
looked after the village revenue records. The services of the Zamindars were utilized
for the maintenance of law and order in their areas as well as in the collection of
revenue. The forts were placed under an officer called Qiladar. He was incharge of
the general administration of the fort and the areas assigned in Jagir to him.
The port administration was independent of the provincial authority. The gover-
nor of the port was called Mutasaddi who was directly appointed by the Em-
peror. The Mutasaddi collected taxes on merchandise and maintained a custom-
house. He also supervised the mint house at the port.

 Administrative System and Institutions
12.11 MUGHAL ADMINISTRATIVE INSTITUTIONS
(i) Mansab System
The mansab and Jagir system under the Mughals in India evolved through the time.
Mansabdari was a unique system devised by the Mughals in India. The mansabdari
system, evolved by Akbar with certain changes and modifications, was the basis of
civil and military administrations under the Mughals. The word mansab means a place
or position. The mansab awarded to an individual fixed both his status in the official
hierarchy and also his salary. It also fixed the number of armed retainers the holders
of mansab was to maintain. The system was formulated to streamline rank of the
nobles, fix their salary and specify the number of cavalry to be maintained by them.
Under the mansab system ranks were expressed in numerical terms. Abul Fazl states
that Akbar had established 66 grades of Mansabdars ranging from commanders of 10
horsemen to 10,000 horsemen, although only 33 grades have been mentioned by him.
Initially a single number represented the rank, personal pay and the size of the contin-
gent of the mansabdar. Later the rank of mansabdar came to be denoted by two num-
bers - Zat and-Sawar. The Zat denoted personal rank of an official and the Sawar
indicated the size of contingents maintained by the mansabdars. Depending on the strength
of contingent Mansabdars were placed in three categories. Let us take the example of
a mansabdar who had a rank of 7000 zat and 7000 sawar (7000/7000). In the first Zat
and Sawar ranks were equal (7000/7000). In the second, Sawar rank was lower than
the Zat but stopped at half, or fifty percent, of the Zat rank (7000/4000). In the third,
Sawar rank was lower than fifty percent of the Zat rank (7000/3000). Thus the Sawar
rank was either equal or less than the Zat. Even if the Sawar rank was higher, the
mansabdar’s position in the official hierarchy would not be affected. It will be decided
by the Zat rank. For example, a mansabdar with 4000 Zat and 2000 Sawar was higher
in rank than a Mansabdar of 3000 Zat and 3000 Sawar.
But there were exceptions to this rule particularly when the mansabdar was serving
in a difficult terrian amidst the rebels. In such cases the state often increased the
Sawar rank without altering the Zat rank. Some times Sawar rank was also increased
for a temporary period to meet emergency situations.
Jahangir introduced a new provision in the Sawar rank. According to it a part of
Sawar rank was termed du-aspa sih-aspa in case of select mansabdars. For this
part additional payment at the same rate 8,000 dams per Sawar was sanctioned. Thus
if the Sawar rank was 4000 out of which 1000 was du-aspa sih-aspa, salary for this
Sawar was calculated as 3,000 × 8,000 + (1,000 × 8,000’ × 2) = 40,000,000 dams.
Without du-aspa sih-aspa, salary for the 4,000 Sawar would have stood at (4,000 ×
8,000) = 32,000,000 dams. Thus the mansabdar was to maintain double number of
Sawars for the du-aspa sih-aspa category and was paid for it. Jahangir probably intro-
duced this provision to promote nobles of his confidence and strengthen them militarily.
By this provision he could increase the military strength of his nobles without effecting
any change in their Zat rank. Any increase in their Zat rank would not only have led to
jealously among other nobles but also an additional burden on the treasury.
Shahjahan introduced the month-scale in the, mansabdari system to compensate the
gap between Jama (estimated income) and hasil (actual realisation). The mansabaars
were generally paid through revenue assignments Jagirs. The biggest problem was
that calculation was made on the basis of the expected income (Jama) from the Jagir
during one year. It was noticed that the actual revenue collection (hasil) always fell"

Notes
HISTORY
 Administrative System and Institutions
short of the estimated income. In such a situation, the mansabdar’s salary were fixed
by a method called month-scale. Thus, if a Jagir yielded only half of the Jama, it was
called Shashmaha (six monthly), if it yielded only one fourth, it was called Sihmaha
(three monthly). The month scale was applied to cash salaries also. There were deduc-
tions from the sanctioned pay also. During the reign of Shahjahan the mansabdars were
allowed to maintain 1/5 to 1/3 of the sanctioned strength of the Sawar rank without any
accompanying reduction in their claim on the maintenance amount for the Sawar rank.
Aurangzeb continued with all these changes and created an additional rank called
Mashrut (conditional). This was an attempt to increase the sawar rank of the
mansabdar temporarily. Aurangzeb added one another deduction called Khurak-i-
dawwab, towards meeting the cost for feed of animals in the imperial stables.
(ii) Jagir System
The system of assignment of revenue of a particular territory to the nobles for their
services to the state continued under the Mughals also. Under the Mughals, the areas
assigned were generally called Jagir and its holders Jagirdars. The Jagirdari system
was an integral part of the mansabdari system which developed under Akbar and under-
went certain changes during the reign of his successors. During Akbar’s period all the
territory was broadly divided into two: Khalisa and Jagir. The revenue from the first went
to imperial treasury, and that from Jagir was assigned to Jagirdars in lieu of their cash
salary. Salary entitlements of mansabdars were calculated on the basis of their Zat and
Sawar ranks. The salary was paid either in cash (in that case they were called Naqdi) or
through the assignment of a Jagir, the latter being the preferable mode. In case the
payment was made through the assignment of a Jagir, the office of the central Diwan
would identify parganas the sum total of whose Jama was equal to the salary claim of the
mansabdars. In case the recorded Jama was in excess of salary claim the assignee was
required to deposit the balance with the central treasury. On the other hand, if it was less
than the salary claim the short fall was paid from the treasury.
However, none of the assignments was permanent or hereditary. The Emperor could
shift part or the entire Jagir from one part of the imperial territory to another at any
time. The ratio between Jagir and Khalisa kept fluctuating during the Mughal rule.
During Akbar’s period Khalisa was only 5% of total revenue, under Jahangir it was
10%, under Shahjahan it fluctuated between 9 to 15%. In the latter part of Aurangzeb’s
reign there was a great pressure on the Khalisa as the number of claimants for Jagir
increased with the increase in the number of mansabdars. The jagirdars were also trans-
ferred from one Jagir to another (but in certain cases they were allowed to keep their
Jagir in one locality for longer period of time). The system of transfer checked the Jagirdars
from developing local roots. At the same time, its disadvantage was that it discouraged the
Jagirdars from taking long term measures for the development of their areas.
There were various types of Jagirs. Tankha Jagirs were given in lieu of salaries,
Mashrut Jagirs were given on certain conditions, Watan Jagirs were assigned to
Zamindar or rajas in their local dominions. Altamgha Jagirs were given to Muslim nobles
in their family towns or place of birth. Tankha Jagirs were transferable every three to
four years. Watan Jagirs were hereditary and non transferable. When a Zamindar was
made a mansabdar, he was given Tankha Jagir apart from his watan Jagir at another
place, if the salary of his rank was more than the income from his watan Jagir.
The Jagirdars were allowed to collect only authorized revenue in accordance with
the imperial regulations. The jagirdars employed their own officials like amil etc. The
imperial office kept watch on the Jagirdars. The Diwan of the suba was supposed"

12.10 ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE UNDER THE MARATHAS
The rise of the Maratha power was a significant phenomenon in the history of the
Deccan. The administrative system of the Marathas was very much influenced by
the administrative system of the Mughals and the Deccani states.
(i) Central Administration
The king was at the helm of the affairs. The administration was divided into eight depart-
ments headed by ministers who are some times called Ashta pradhan. The eight minis-
ters were (1) Peshwa who looked after the finances and general administration. (2) Sar-
i-Naubat who was the Senapati. (3) Majumdar looked after the accounts. (4) Waqai
navis looked after the intelligence, post and household affairs (5) Surnavis or Chitnis
looked after official correspondence (6) Dabir looked after foreign affairs (7) Nyayadhish
looked after justice and (8) Pandit Rao looked after ecclesiastical affairs.
The ashtapradhan was not a creation of Shivaji. Many of these officers like Peshwa,
Majumdar, Waqai navis, Dabir and Surnavis had existed under the Deccani rulers
also. All the members of the astha pradhan except Pandit Rao and Nyaydhish were
asked to lead military campaigns. Under Shivaji these offices were neither hereditary
nor permanent. They held the office at the pleasure of the king. They were also
frequently transferred. Each of the ashta pradhan was assisted by eight assistants
diwan, Majumdar , Fadnis, Sabnis; Karkhanis, Chitnis, Jamadar and Potnis.
Chitnis dealt with all diplomatic correspondences and wrote all royal letters. The
Fadnis used to respond to the letters of commanders of the forts. The potnis looked
after the income and expenditure of the royal treasury.
(ii) Provincial and Local Administration
The provincial administration was also organized on the Deccani and Mughal system.
All the provincial units were already existing under the Deccani rulers. Shivaji reorga-
nized and in certain cases renamed them. The provinces were known as Prants. The
Prants were under the charge of subedar. Over a number of Subedar there were
Sarsubedar to control and supervise the work of subedar. Smaller than prant were
Tarfs which were headed by a havaldar. Then there were Mauzas or villages which
were the lowest unit of administration. At the level of village, Kulkarni used to keep"

accounts and maintained records while Patil had legal and policing power. At the level
of Pargana, Deshpande used to keep account and maintain records while Deshmukh
had legal and policing powers. The Police officer in rural area was called Faujdar and
in urban area was called Kotwal. The Maratha polity did not have unified civilian-cum-
military rank. Under the Marathas performance based Brahmin elites manned the cen-
tral bureaucracy and the local administration. In this capacity they were called
Kamvishdar who enjoyed wide powers of tax assessment and collection. They adjudi-
cated cases, provided information about local conditions and kept records. Later on, the
British District collector was modelled on this Maratha officer only.

WHAT YOU HA VE LEARNT
You have seen that with the establishment of Delhi Sultanate, new ruling class and some
new administrative institutions emerged. The administrative institutions were of mix origin
i.e., Arab and Central Asian origin and Indian origin . During the Mughal period some of the
institution of the Sultanate period underwent some changes and some new were created.
The administration system and institutions contributed in the consolidation of the Sultanate
and Mughal empire. The administrative system was also utilized by the rulers to create
social harmony in the society. This was done by including more and more sections of the
society in the administrative apparatus. Due to the large extent of the empire the administra-
tive system emerged at three levels i.e. central, provincial and local. The local level admin-
istration was left mainly in the hands of village headmen etc. At provincial level, the admin-
istration was carried out through the institution of Iqta during the sultanate period and
through the institution of mansab and jagir during the Mughal period. At the central
level the sultan or the emperor had his own system of administration and there were
many officers to assist him. There were also various departments to look after certain
functions. The rulers at times were challenged by the nobility and the Ulema who tried
to exert pressure on them. The administrative system and institutions functioned well under
strong and capable ruler but the same were under pressure under weak rulers. The Maratha
administrative system developed along the lines of the Mughal and Deccani states.

Notes
The people in medieval India pursued diverse range of economic activities to earn their
basic livelihood. The sphere of their works varied from agricultural to artisanal production,
trade and commerce and associated commercial and financial services. These activities
underwent various changes through out the course of this period. The state mobilized its
resources through collection of different types of taxes for its survival and expansion.
In this lesson, you will learn about various ways and means of production, mobilization of
resources by the state and the trade and commercial activities. In the section on agricul-
tural production, we will discuss extent of cultivation, crop pattern and means and methods
of irrigation. Under the taxation system land revenue administration, role of landed inter-
mediaries in the revenue administration and burden on peasantry will be analysed. In the
section on non-agricultural production, you will learn about a wide variety of medieval
Indian crafts, technologies of production involved therein and organisation of production.
You will also learn various aspects of the medieval Indian trade and commerce like com-
mercial classes such as the sarrafs, merchants, brokers etc. and commercial practices,
such as, bills of exchange (hundi), brokerage, insurance etc.
OBJECTIVES
After studying this lesson you will be able to:
 know the extent of cultivation; main crops grown;means and methods of irriga-
tion in India;
 analyze revenue system of Medieval India;

13.1 AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
Agricultural production constituted the bulk of production during medieval period. The
income from agriculture was the main source of state revenue."

 Economy
(i) Extent of Cultivation
Extent of cultivation may be understood in terms of actual area under the plough in
relation to the total available cultivable land. It is to be noted that there was a favourable
ratio of land to man i.e., availability of land in surplus than the actual land cultivated by
peasants. In such a situation an increase in production was sought through expansion
of agriculture i.e., bringing newer areas under cultivation.
We are informed, for instance, by the contemporary sources that large tracts of land
in even such fertile regions as the Ganga-Yamuna Doab were covered by forests and
grasslands during the Sultanate period. Land continued to exist in a favourable ratio to
man during the Mughal period as well.
The rulers of this era, therefore, harped on the policy of expansion of agriculture to such
areas which were hitherto not under cultivation. Agriculture was introduced to tribal,
backward, and outlying areas. Forests were cleared and agricultural wastelands were
converted into cultivable lands. Extent of agriculture expanded in good proportions from
the Sultanate to Mughal period. By the Mughal period, agriculture was practiced in
almost all parts of the empire, yet land still existed in huge surplus than the actual re-
quirement of the Mughal agricultural population. The extent of cultivation significantly
increased during the reign of Aurangzeb in comparison to the Akbar’s reign. The expan-
sion of cultivation in Bihar, Awadh and parts of Bengal is ascribed to clearance of forest,
whereas in Punjab and Sind, to the spread of canal network.
(ii) Crop Pattern
The medieval Indian peasants produced a variety of food crops, cash crops, veg-
etables and spices. They were familiar with various advanced techniques of crop
cultivation of their times viz., double cropping, three crops harvesting, crop rotation,
use of manures and range of devices for irrigation etc.
a. Food crops:  The principal food crops produced were rice, wheat, barley,
mil-let (jowar,’bajra) and a variety of pulses such as gram, arhar, moong,
moth, urd, khisari etc.
b. Cash crops:  Sugarcane, cotton, indigo (used to extract blue dye), opium, silk
etc. were some of the prominent cash crops of medieval India. Making of
wine from sugarcane became widespread by the fourteenth century. During
the Mughal period, sugarcane was the most widely grown cash crop with
Bengal producing the finest quality.
During the Mughal period, Bayana (near Agra) and Sarkhej (near Ahmedabad)
produced the best quality Indigo. Sericulture (rearing of silk worms on mulbery
plant), which was practised on a modest scale till the Sultanate period, became
widespread during the Mughal period. Bengal emerged as the main region of
silk production. The Mughal provinces of Bihar and Malwa produced the finest
quality of opium. Tobacco cultivation was introduced in India by the Portuguese
during the sixteenth century and it became widespread in the subsequent pe-
riod. Surat and Bihar emerged as major tobacco producing centres. Similarly,
from the seventeenth century, cultivation of coffee began on a large scale.

vicinity of Delhi. Mughal emperors and their nobles also planted lavish or-
chards.
During the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, a number of
fruits were introduced in India through outside agencies. The Portuguese for
instance, introduced pineapple, papaya and cashew nut; etc. Cherry was
brought from Kabul. Leechi and guava were also introduced during this
period. A wide range of vegetables were also produced by the medieval In-
dian peasants. Abul FazI, in his Ain-i-Akbari, gives a list of vegetables which
were, in use at that time. Potato, Chilies and tomato were introduced during
the late medieval period.
d. Spices:  Pepper, clove, cardamom, turmeric, saffron, betel-leaf, etc. were
some of the important spices produced by the medieval Indian peasants. By
the Mughal period, the southern coast of India began exporting in large quan-
tities different kinds of spices to various regions in Asia and Europe.
(iii) Means and Methods of Irrigation
The Indian agriculture has always depended on various sources of water both natural and
artificial, for its irrigational requirements, viz - rain, wells, river, tanks, canals, lakes, etc.
Dams, lakes and water reservoirs were some of the important means of irrigation. In
south India, the state, local chiefs and temple managements constructed a number of
dams over rivers for this purpose. The Madag lake, for instance, was built by the
Vijaynagar rulers on the Tungbhadra river to meet the irrigational need of the adjoin-
ing territories. Lakes and water reservoirs such as the Dhebar, Udaisagar, Rajasamand
and Jaisamand (all in Mewar); Balsan (Marwar) and Mansagar (Amber) etc. served
as important sources of irrigation in medieval Rajasthan.
Wells, as a common source of irrigation, were uniformly spread in different parts of
the country. A number of artificial devices were used to lift water from wells. Pulleys
were employed over wells for this purpose. Another device worked on the lever
principle. In this method, fork of an upright beam was kept in a swinging position with
its one end tied with a long rope and the other carried a weight heavier than the filled
bucket. The Persian wheel which began to be used in India from the Sultanate pe-
riod, however, was the most advanced water lifting device of this period. In  this
method, a garland of pots was attached to the rim of a wheel, a gear mechanism was
also attached to it, and with the help of animal power this wheel was made to rotate.
The Delhi Sultans, in particular, promoted canal irrigation. Ghiyassuddin Tughlaq
(A.D 1320–1325) built a number of canals for this purpose. However, Firuz Shah Tughlaq
laid the largest network of canals. Four such canals are frequently mentioned in contempo-
rary sources. These were - (i) from Sutlej to Ghaggar, (ii) Opening from the Nandavi and
Simur hills to Arasani, (iii) from Ghaggar, reaching upto the village to Hiransi Khera, and (iv)
excavated from Yamuna and extended upto Firuzabad. The tradition of Delhi Sultans to
construct canals was continued by the Mughal emperors as well. The Nahr Faiz, for in-
stance, built during Shahjahan’s reign carried water from Yamuna and irrigated a large area.

13.2 LAND REVENUE ASSESSMENT AND MAGNITUDE OF THE
LAND REVENUE DEMAND
The medieval state derived the largest share of its income from land revenue. An elabo-
rate mechanism of land revenue administration gradually developed due to efforts of
medieval rulers like Alauddin Khalji, Sher Shah Suri and Akbar. In its developed form,
the land revenue administration involved well formulated policies. These were: (i) actual
measurement of cultivable land for the purpose of assessment of land revenue (ii) clas-
sification of land on the basis of the fertility of soil (iii) fixation of rate of the land revenue
demand (iv) establishment of elaborate mechanism for its collection, and (v) working
out modalities for assessment and collection of land revenue in cash.
During the medieval period different methods of revenue assessment and collection
were used. The most simple and basic method was crop sharing or batai. The state
fixed a certain ratio of produce as state’s share. In this method out of the total produce
the state share was collected by designated official. Here the measurement of land had
no bearing on revenue collection. The actual produce was the main focus of attention.
Crop Sharing
Three types of crop sharing was in practice. These were - first, division of crop at thresh-
ing floor after the grain was obtained; second, Khet-batai, i.e. division of field when the
crop was standing; and third, the Langbatai in which the crop was cut and stacked in
heaps without separating grain. The share of the state was decided in this form.
In the second method known as Kankut the measurement was important. In this
method land was first measured. After measurement the productivity of land was
estimated to fix the revenue demand per unit of measured area. Sher Shah improved
the method of assessment. For estimating the productivity sample cutting from three
types of land i.e. good, middling and bad lands was taken and an average yield was
obtained. The State demand was fixed at 1/3rd of the average yield.
Revenue demand per bigha for every crop was declared and was known as rai of
Sher Shah. During initial years of Akbar these rates were adopted for the whole
empire. Here the state demand was expressed in kind but could be collected/paid in
cash after applying prevalent prices on them.
This Third method was called Zabt since the assessment was done on the basis of
measurement. Based on yields the share of the state was decided. Under Akbar the
method was further refined. All the territories were divided into the revenue circles or
dasturs. For each dastur circle per bigha revenue rates for different crops in cash
based on productivity and prices was worked out."

The problem of compiling fresh rates every year for different localities was over-
come through adoption of Ain-i-Dahsala or ten years revenue rates According to
this the average of the rates of last ten years was taken as cash revenue rate for a
particular crop. However, these were changed at irregular intervals and not updated
every year. In the beginning it was implemented in the provinces of Agra, AIlahabad,
Awadh, Delhi, Lahore and Malwa. Later it was extended to some other regions.
However at no point of time all the land in a particular region was measured. That
would suggest that even in measured territories some territories remained unmea-
sured. In such a situation even in the zabti regions other methods of assessment and
collection were followed in almost all parts of the country.
Classification of land
After the measurement, the cultivable land was classified, on the basis of the fertility
of land, into three categories- good, middling and bad. Land was further classified
into four categories viz -polaj, parati, chachar and banjar, on the basis of continu-
ity of cultivation. The Polaj land was one in which two crops were raised every
year; Parati land, however, had to be left fallow (uncultivated) for some time, after
raising two crops to recover its fertility; the Chachar was an unfertile tract of land
which was brought under cultivation once in every three or four years; and the Banjar
land which was unfit for cultivation and therefore rarely brought under plough.
The land revenue constituted the bulk of the state’s income. The state, therefore,
constantly tried to expand the territory under cultivation to maximize its revenue re-
turns. All efforts of the State were also focussed in ensuring maximum realization of
revenue from the cultivators.
The Mughal land revenue administration was organised at the pargana level. The
task of surveying of land and collection of revenue was entrusted to different offi-
cials. Amin was the head of the surveying party whereas the amil was incharge of
revenue collections. The amin was assisted by the qanungo who was repository of
all revenue records. The chaudhari assisted the amil in this work of revenue collec-
tion. At the village level, the records were maintained by the patwari and collections
were made by the muqaddam or village headman. There were other officials such as
potadar or treasurer and karkun or clerk. The records were maintained both in
Persian and languages of the region.
Patta and Qabuliat
Each cultivator was given a document by the state called patta (title deed) which
gave all the details of the various categories of land held by the cultivator and rate of
land revenue payable by him on different crops. A deed agreement called Qabuliat,
according to which the cultivator made a promise to pay a particular amount of land
revenue to the state, was taken from the cultivator. In addition to the land revenue,
the cultivators were also required to pay certain additional cesses, in order to meet
the cost of assessment and collection of revenues.

13.3 ROLE OF LANDED INTERMEDIARIES IN REVENUE
COLLECTION
Apart form state officials various categories of intermediaries existed between the
peasants and the state. These intermediaries played a crucial role in land revenue
realization. They claimed revenue exemptions on their lands or a share in land rev-
enue in return for the services rendered by them.
Prior to the establishment of the Delhi sultanate our sources refer to terms like raja,
rajaputra, ranaka, mahasamanta etc. These were hereditary right holders con-
nected with land. They collected land revenue from peasants of their respective ar-
eas, sent a part of it to the state and kept a part with themselves for their sustenance.
Besides, as we have seen, the state granted tax-exempt land to Brahamans and temples.
Land revenue from such areas were collected by these grantees.
During the Sultanate period, landed intermediaries continued to play an important role
in revenue collection. Khuts (small landlords), Muqaddams (village headmen) and a
group of intermediaries, such as, rai, rana, rawats etc., enjoyed superior rights over
land as compared to an average peasant. Alauddin Khalji tried to curtail the powers
and shares of these groups. Later Delhi Sultans like Ghiyassuddin and Firuz Shah
Tughlaq gave certain concessions to them.
During the Mughal period rais, ranas, rawats  and other such intermediaries are
referred as zamindar. They were the people who had hereditary rights over the
produce of the land.
The zamindars claimed a direct share in the peasants produce. Their share varied
from 10% to 25% in different parts of the country. These claims co-existed in a
subordinate capacity with the land revenue demand of the state. Zamindars also
assisted the state and jagirdar in the collection of land revenue. Iqta of the Sultanate
period in a modified form became Jagir under the Mughals. Its holders (jagirdars)
were paid through revenue assignments. We have already discussed them in chapter
12. The muqaddams (in north India) and patels (in Deccan) acted as village head-
men who were responsible for collection of revenue and maintenance of law and
order in the village. For their services, they were granted revenue free village land.
The patwari (in north India) and kulkarni (in Deccan), who served as village ac-
countants, were also paid similarly.
13.4 BURDEN ON PEASANTRY
Peasants formed the overwhelming majority of the population in medieval India. It
was, however, not a homogenous group. One end of the spectrum was represented"

213
by rich peasants (khuts & muqaddams during Delhi Sultanate and khudkasht during
the Mughal period), having large holdings and cultivating their lands with the help of
hired labour. The other end was represented by small peasants and village menials
(known in various parts of India as balahars, reza ria’ya, paltis, kunbis, pahika’asht,
upari etc.). Bulk of the peasantry was known by the generic term raiyat.
Overall, the peasants had to pay large parts of their produce as land revenue. Be-
sides, a large number of landed intermediaries appropriated a share in the surplus of
produce. Apart from it, the medieval Indian peasants also had to deal with frequent
natural calamities like flood, famine, epidemics etc. An average peasant always found
himself subsisting on margins owing to the regressive nature of land tax, the extensive
burden of interaction on loans taken, frequent famine, disease and epidemic.
The peasant hardships and resentments, occasionally, culminated in protests and revolts.
During the Sultanate period, Muhammad bin Tughlaq’s effort to enhance the revenue rates
in the doab region led to a very serious agrarian uprising in the region. Large scale uprisings
of the Jats, Sikh, Marathas, and Satanamis, took place during the reign of Emperor
Aurangzeb. Agrarian discontentment was one of the factors behind these rebellious acts.

13.5 ARTISANAL (NON-AGRICULTURAL) PRODUCTION
Though agriculture formed the occupation of the bulk of the people, a variety of crafts
also existed on a significant scale in rural as well as urban areas of the country. These
crafts included textile, pottery making, dyeing, sugar making, metal works, paper making,
wood work, arms and armour manufacturing, ship-building, chemical works etc.
Prominent Crafts
The textile production was one of the most widely practised crafts of medieval India.
The Indian weavers produced four major types of fabric - cotton, silk, woollen, and
mixed coarse cotton. Bengal, Lahore, Agra, Awadh, Patna, Fatehpur Sikri and Gujarat
etc. were prominent cotton textile production regions. Kashmir, Lahore and Agra
were major shawl and carpet making centres. Apart from manufacturing, Bengal and
Gujarat were renowned for the export of textile goods.
The art of dyeing or bleaching developed as a separate and specialised craft during
this period. Bharuch, Ahmadabad, Surat, Patna, Sonargaon, Dacca, Masulipattam
etc. were major dyeing or bleaching centres.
Sugar was manufactured all over the country. Sugar in its variants - Gur; powder, fine
grained sugar etc. were produced in Bengal, Orissa, Ahmedabad, Lahore, Multan and
many other places."

 Economy
Mineral extraction was another major industry. Salt, saltpetre, alum, mica etc. were
produced on a large scale. The Sambhar lake in Rajasthan, the Punjab rock salt mines
and sea water were some major sources of salt production. Sea salt was mainly
manufactured in Bengal, Sind, Malabar, Mysore and the Rann of Kutch. Saltpetre,
primarily used as an ingredient for manufacturing gun powder, was one of the most
important mineral products. Initially, it was extracted at Ahmadabad, Baroda, Patna
etc.. However, by the second half of the seventeenth century, Patna became one of
the most important centres for processing this mineral.
Among metals, India was deficient in gold and silver mines. These metals, therefore,
were mostly imported. Diamond mining was carried out most notably at Golconda.
Some other centres of diamond production were Biragarh (Berar), Panna (Madhya
Pradesh), Khokhra (Chotanagpur) etc.. Khetri (Rajasthan) was the main centre for
copper production. Iron was the most commonly found metal. Bengal, Allahabad,
Agra, Bihar, Gujarat, Delhi, Kashmir, Chotanagpur and adjoining regions of Orissa
were major iron producing centres of the medieval period.
Paper making, as a craft, was introduced in India during the Sultanate period. It was first
manufactured in China around the first century A.D. The craft grew at a fast pace. The
manufacture of paper was prevalent during the Mughal period in almost every region.
The medieval period witnessed advent of a number of new technological devices and
their application in diverse sectors.
In the textile sector, introduction of the spinning wheel (charkha), during the thir-
teenth-fourteenth centuries, was the most important technological innovation. It speeded
up yarn production by six times in comparison to the spindle based yarn production.
Similarly, pit loom was introduced in India during the fifteenth century, which speeded
up the process of weaving. Drawloom was another important weaving device which
was used for simultaneous patterned weave of different colours. Similarly, block-print-
ing is also attributed by some scholars to the medieval Indian period.
In the sector of metallurgy and metal works, many new technologies were introduced
in the process of manufacturing. Some of such technologies were -employment of
vertical bore pits, deep mines with oval shafts, use of pulley etc. Production of high
quality steel and bidri alloy of copper and zinc were new metal works of this period.
In the arms and armour manufacturing sector, use of gunpowder, canon, firearm etc,
were some of the most important medieval innovations. The modern artillery was
mainly brought to India, on the one hand, by Babur (who had received it from Persia),
on the other hand, by the Portuguese. Besides, Fatullah Shirazi, an outstanding scholar
and engineer of Akbar’s regime, made some invaluable innovations in this sector.
Paper-making, as we have noted above, entered India during this period. Along with
it also developed the craft of book binding.
Although, glass making technology was known to the Indians during the ancient pe-
riod, its use was restricted to manufacturing beads and bangles. During the medieval
period, various other glass products such as, pharmaceutical phials, vessels etc. also
began to be manufactured. The practice of tin coating also entered India along with
the advent of the Turks. This technology involved coating of tin inside the copper and
brass utensils to prevent the food from acid poisoning.
Organisation of Production
Craft production was organised in villages as well as qasbas. There also existed
imperial Karkhanas. In rural areas, artisans produced articles of daily use. These"

artisans were part of the village social network called the jajmani system. This sys-
tem was more organised in Deccan and Maharashtra. The village artisans and ser-
vants in these regions were called balutedars.
Town based individual artisans formed the nucleus of such commodities which were
produced for markets. Almost every craft had specialised artisans who produced
articles for the market. At this level of the organisation of craft production, the indi-
vidual artisan himself procured necessary raw materials and tools, manufactured com-
modities, and sold those in the market.
This mode of artisanal production, however, suffered from a major weakness. Since the
production was organised on individual basis, an artisan lacked big resources to invest in
the production process. Naturally, the size of final production remained small. A revised
form of production called the dadni system gradually developed to address this prob-
lem. In this system, an artisan was provided with necessary raw materials and advance
money by such merchants who traded in those commodities. After the expiry of stipu-
lated time, the merchants collected finished goods and sold them in the market.
Royal workshop (karkhana) was another unit of craft production. These karkhanas
were part of the royal establishment. These units produced commodities for the con-
sumption of the royal household and the court, Generally, expensive and luxury items
were produced here. The Karkhanas employed skilled workers who worked under
one roof and were supervised by state officials. Apparently two distinct types of
Karkhanas existed. First, the traditional type of Karkhanas, which produced luxury
goods in small quantity, but of high, artistic value; second, mints or arms manufactur-
ing units, wherein standard oriented and technologically advanced large scale produc-
tion took place.

 13.6 TRADE AND COMMERCE
India had a fairly developed external and internal trade during the medieval period.
The internal trade developed along local, regional and inter-regional levels. Trade
relations with regions like China, Arabia, Egypt, Central Asia, Afghanistan were main-
tained on land routes. It carried its overseas trade with the Persian Gulf, the South
China sea, the Mediterranean and the Red sea. The advent of European trading
companies - the Portuguese, British, Dutch and French intensified trading activities in"

the Indian subcontinent. The Asian maritime trade also increased during this period.
This period also witnessed proliferation of a variety of new commercial activities
such as, money lending, brokerage, insurance etc. We notice a large number of mer-
chants, sarrafs, brokers etc. playing active role in commercial activities.
(i) Inland Trade
By the Mughal period, inland trade had developed considerably. Every locality had
regular markets in nearby towns where people from the surrounding areas could sell
and purchase things. Besides, trade at the local level was also conducted through
periodic markets known as Hats or Penths, which were held on fixed days in a week.
In these local markets, commodities like food grain, salt, wooden and iron equipments,
coarse cotton textile etc. were available.
These local markets were linked to bigger commercial centres in that particular re-
gion. These centres served as markets for products not only from their specific region
but also from other regions. Delhi, Agra, Lahore, Multan, Bijapur, Hyderabad, Calicut,
Cochin, Patna etc. were some of such trading regions during the Mughal period.
A brisk inter-regional trade was conducted in luxury commodities. Ziauddin Barani in
his Ta’arikh-i-Firuzshahi shows that Delhi during the Sultanate period received dis-
tilled wine from Kol (Aligarh), muslin from Devagiri, stripped cloth from Lakhnauati
and ordinary cloth from Awadh. During the Mughal period, Bengal with its important
trading centres - Hugli, Dacca, Murshidabad, Satagaon, Patna had well developed
inter-regional trade with all parts of India. Similarly, Surat and Ahmadabad in Western
India and Agra in North India were some of the important centres with fairly devel-
oped inter-regional trade.
(ii) Foreign Trade
India had traditionally been maintaining trade relations with other countries. During
the early medieval period (i.e. from the tenth century onward), India carried trade
with contemporary China, Arabia and Egypt. India also had high stake in the sea trade
between the Persian Gulf and the South China sea. India imported silk, porcelain
ware, camphor, cloves, wax, sandalwood etc from China and South Asia and horses
from places such as Bahrin, Muscat, Aden, Persia etc. The Indian exports included
aromatics and spices, cotton cloth, ivory and precious and semi-precious stones etc.
During the Sultanate period, India had trade relations with Central Asia, Afghanistan,
the Persian gulf and the Red sea. India mainly exported food grains, textile, slaves,
indigo, precious stones etc. whereas it imported precious metals like gold and silver,
horses, brocade and silk stuff etc.
India, during the Mughal period, witnessed further intensification of her foreign trade
owing to the advent of the European trading companies and their direct participation
in the Euro-Asian and Intra-Asian trade. India had trade relations with central Asia,
Persia and Europe. Her major export included textiles, saltpetre, sugar, opium and
spices. In comparison to her export, her imports were limited to a few select com-
modities like silver, silk, porcelain, good quality wine, carpets, perfume, glass, watches,
silver utensils, horses etc.
(iii) The Mercantile Community
Throughout the course of the medieval period in India, the mercantile community
played an important role in the contemporary economy and society."

During the Sultanate period, Karwanis or Nayakas were merchants, who specialised
in carrying grains from the rural areas. The Persian term Karwanis meant those who
moved together in large number. These people came to be called banjaras in the
later centuries. We also get references of Multani merchant who specialised in long
distance trade. They were mostly Hindu merchants.
We hear of a number of mercantile classes during the Mughal period. Banjaras have
innumerable references in the contemporary literature as a trading group who carried
on trade between villages and between village and towns. They generally moved with
their families and households in groups. The Multani merchants continued to thrive
during this period as well in places such as Delhi, parts of Punjab and Sind. Baniya
was another important mercantile community in north India and Deccan. Their coun-
terparts were Khatris in Punjab and Komatis in Golconda. Apart from their involve-
ment in trade, they also acted as moneylenders. The Bohras were another prominent
mercantile community during the Mughal period. It had a very strong presence in
Gujarat, Ujjain and Burhanpur. Some of the other prominent mercantile groups were
Chettis (South India), Kling (along Coromandel coast upto Orissa), Komatis (Telegu
speaking merchant group) etc.
(a) Sarrafs:  It was a yet another community engaged in monetary transactions.
References to this community began to appear from the Sultanate period. How-
ever, by the Mughal period, it developed three distinct functions.
i. Money changers - in this role, a sarraf was considered an expert in judging
the metallic purity of coins as well as their weight. He also determined the
current exchange rate of specific coins.
ii. as bankers, they received deposits and gave loans on interest.
iii. as traders, they dealt in gold, silver and jewellery. Besides, they also issued
hundis or bills of exchange.
(b) Brokers:  Known as dalal, it was another important commercial class. It emerged
during the Sultanate period. However, brokerage became a widespread com-
mercial practice during the Mughal period. They worked as middlemen in vari-
ous commercial activities and transactions. The foreign merchants, who were
unacquainted with the centres of production, pattern of marketing and languages,
mainly depended upon brokers for their trading. These brokers worked in various
capacities. Some of them were employed by merchants or companies. Some
worked as independent broker serving many clients at a time. A few of them
worked as state appointed brokers at commercial centres to register sale and
purchase of articles. Brokers fee was not strictly fixed. It depended on the com-
modity and the efforts of the broker to strike the deal.
(iv) Commercial Practices
Along with the development of trade and  commercial classes, some new commercial
practices also developed during the medieval period.
a. Hundi: Hundi or bills of exchange was a  medieval commercial practice. A
hundi was essentially a paper document promising payment of money after
a fixed period of time at a certain place. This practice started because of the
problems involved in carrying large amounts of cash from one place to an-
other. The sarrafs, who played the key role in hundi transaction, generally"

had number of establishments across various towns and cities. They issued
hundis to merchants after accepting the cash to be transferred. The hundis
indicated the amount, period and place of encashment. The persons carried
hundis to their destinations, presented it to the agents of issuing sarrafs and
encashed the value indicated. Apart from merchants state officials and other
nobles also used it for transferring money. The hundi system established a
safe and convenient method of transferring money. The sarrafs charged a
commission for every hundi they issued.
b. Insurance: This practice became widespread, especially during the Mughal
period. Certain insurance firms (mostly dominated by sarrafs) developed
which took upon themselves the responsibility of safe passage and delivery
of commercial goods. In case, any damage to the goods in transit happened,
these firms were liable to pay compensations. A commission was charged as
insurance cover of such goods.   The rate of commission varied according to
different regions and goods. The rate for overseas transportation of goods
was higher than goods going overland.
13.7 THE CURRENCY SYSTEM
The silver and copper coins were mainly in circulation for cash transactions. Under
Sultanate the pure silver tanka with fluctuating proportion of silver was the main
coinage. The jital and dang were copper coins. The value of coinage fluctuated with
the change in the prices of metals.

Under Sher Shah for the first time the purity of metals in coinage of gold, silver and
copper was established. The rupaya of silver came to be used as the basic coin for
transactions. It was of 178 grains. The same continued under Akbar with minor fluc-
tuation under his successors. The copper dam of the Mughals was 323 grains. The
value of silver rupee to copper dam fluctuated as per the availability or scarcity of
silver. During Akbar’s period 1 silver rupee was enqual to 40 copper dams. The gold
or ashrafi had a weight of 169 grains.
The coins were minted at the royal mints spread in all ports of the kingdom. During
Akbar’s period Gold coins were issued from 4 mints, silver coins from 14 and copper
coins from 42 mints. The number of rupee mints increased to 40 by Aurangzeb’s time.

WHAT YOU HA VE LEARNT
Let’s briefly recapitulate the main points of this lesson.
Agriculture formed the occupation of the bulk of the people. An increase in agricul-
tural production was sought through expansion of agriculture in newer areas as part
of state policy. The peasants produced a large variety of food crops, cash crops,
fruits, vegetables and spices. They practised advanced agricultural techniques such
as croprotation, double cropping, three crop harvesting, fruit grafting etc. Various
types of artificial water lifting devices were also used for this purpose. The state
derived the largest part of its income from land revenue. The land revenue adminis-
tration was streamlined and elaborately developed as a result of some of the pioneer-
ing efforts made in this field by rulers like Alauddin Khalji, Sher Shah Suri and Akbar.
A powerful group of revenue intermediaries existed in between the state and the
peasantry. They enjoyed some hereditary or state granted rights (either as religious
grants or grants in lieu of their services) over appropriation of land revenue from the
designated areas. These intermediaries assisted the state in the process of land rev-
enue collection. The medieval Indian peasantry was a hard pressed lot. The repres-
sive nature of land tax,  demand of share in revenue by intermediaries, frequent natu-
ral calamities rendered the life of an average peasant dismal and deplorable. Peasant
revolts, therefore, were not altogether unknown during this period."

Textile, mining and metallurgy, ship-building, construction works, arms and armour
manufacturing, were some of the prominent crafts practised during this period. Craft
production was organised at various levels of village, towns and the state, wherein
state owned artisanal workshops (royal Karkhanas) produced commodities for the
consumption of the ruling elite.
In the field of commerce India had trade links with contemporary central Asia, China,
South-east Asia and Europe etc. The European trading companies viz., the Portu-
guese, English, Dutch and French, and their participation in the Indian, Intra-Asian,
and Euro-Asian trade influenced Indian commence.

14.1 SUFISM
‘Sufism’ is a term used to refer to mystical religious ideas in Islam. It had evolved into
a well developed movement by the 11 th century. Sufis, stress on the importance of
traversing the path of the Sufi pir enabling one to establish a direct communion with
the divine. Sufism or mysticism emerged in the 8th century and among the early known
Sufis were Rabia al-Adawiya, Al-Junaid and Bayazid Bastami. Fundamental to sufism
is God, Man and the relation between them that is Love. They believe that from man
emerged the theories of ruh (soul), qurbat (divine proximity) and hulul (infusion of
the divine spirit) and that from relation between God and Man ideas such as Ishq
(divine love) and Fana (self annihilation) come into being. The Sufis were regarded
as people who kept their heart pure; they sought to communicate with God though
their ascetic practices and doctrine of divine love and union with God. The murid
(disciple) passes through maqamat (various stages) in this process of experiencing
communication with the divine.
The khanqah (the hospice) was the center of activities of the various sufis orders.
The khanqah was led by shaikh, pir or murshid (teacher) who lived with his mu-
rids (disciples). In time the Khanqahs emerged as important centres of learning and
preaching. By the twelfth century the sufis were organized in silsilahs (orders). The
word silsila meant chain and it represented signifying an unbreakable chain between
the pir and the murid. With the death of the pir his tomb or shrine the dargah
became a centre for his disciples and followers.
In the 10 th century Sufism spread across important regions of the Islamic empire.
Iran, Khurasan, Transoxiana, Egypt, Syria and Baghdad were important Sufi centers.
Al-Ghazali, (1059–1111 A.D.) is among the most venerated of Sufis. He reconciled
Islamic mysticism with Islamic orthodoxy, providing Sufi mysticism a secure place in
Islam. He stressed on the need for the disciple to follow the guidance of the spiritual
master. He also emphasised on the supreme authority of the holy Prophet and the
need to obey laws in both letter and spirit
The Sufi movement in India commenced in the 11 th century A.D. Al Hujwiri, who
established himself in north India was buried in Lahore and regarded as the oldest
Sufi in the sub Continent. Among the important Sufi Orders in the history of Medieval
India were those of the Chishtitiya, Suhrawardiya, Qadiriya and Naqshbandiya.
Chisti and the Suhrawardi silsilahs were popular during the Sultanate period. The
Suhrawardis were active in Punjab and Sindh while the Chishti’s were active in Delhi,
Rajasthan and parts of the western gangetic plains. By the end of the sultanate period
they had spread to the eastern regions of the gangetic plain (Bihar and Bengal) and
into the Deccan. During the medieval period the Sufis played an important role in
interpreting and elaborating on Islamic theological concepts like Wahdat ul Wujud
(unity of being) and also encouraged the development of practices like Ziyarat (the
practice of visiting tombs).
The Sufi movement as it emerged in India had the following features:
 The Sufis were organized in a number of different silsilahs (orders)
 Most of these orders were led by some prominent sufi saint or pir. It was named
after them and was followed by his disciples.
 The Sufis believed that for union with God one needs a spiritual guru or Pir.
 The sufi pirs lived in Khanqahs with their disciples"

 The Khanqah (the hospice) was the centre of sufi activities
 The Khanqahs emerged as important centres of learning which were different
from madrasas the centres of theology
 Many sufis enjoyed the musical congregation or sama in their Khanqahs. A mu-
sical form called the qawwali developed during this period.
 The ziyarat or pilgrimage to the tombs of the sufi saints soon emerged as an
important form of ritual pilgrimage.
 Most of the Sufis believed in the performance of miracles. Almost all pirs were
associated with the miracles performed by them.
 The different sufi orders had diverse approaches about the matters of polity and
state.
The Chishti Silsilah
The Chisti Order was established in India by Muinuddin Chishti. He seems to have
moved into India after the invasion of Muizzuddin Muhammad Ghori and subsequently
to Ajmer in 1206. The fame of Khwaja Muinuddin grew after his death in 1235, his
grave was visited by Muhammad Tughlaq after which the mosque and dome were
erected by Mahmud Khalji of Malwa in the fifteenth century. The patronage of this
dargah peaked after the reign of the Mughal emperor Akbar.
The Chishtis believed in:
 love as the bond between God and individual soul,
 the tolerance between people of different faiths,
 acceptance of disciples irrespective of their religious beliefs,
 attitude of benevolence to all,
 association with Hindu and Jain yogi’s, and
 use of simple language

 Cultural Developments in Medieval India
The Chishti presence in Delhi was established by Qutbuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki who
settled in Delhi from his homeland in Transoxiana in 1221. This was at the time of the
Mongol invasions when there was a steady flow of people from central Asia fleeing
from the Mongols. His presence in Delhi was a threat to the Suhrawardis who sought
to force him to leave by levelling charges against him. The Sultan of Delhi, Itutmish,
dismissed these attempts eventually forcing the Suhrawardis to relent. The Chishti
pirs laid great emphasis on the simplicity of life, poverty, humility and selfless devo-
tion to God. The renunciation of worldly possessions was regarded by them as neces-
sary for the control of the senses that was necessary to maintain a spiritual life.
Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti argued that highest form of devotion to God was to re-
dress the misery of those in distress, fulfilling the need of the helpless and to feed the
hungry. They refused to accept any grant for their maintenance from the Sultans.
The other important Chishti Baba Fariduddin Ganj-i-Shakar, established himself at
Hansi (in Haryana) on the route between Multan and Lahore. Nizamuddin Auliya,
was the best known Chishti saint of the Sultanate period. He lived in the fourteenth
century, during a period of political change and turmoil. During his lifetime he was
witness to the establishment of the Khalji rule after the death of Balban and subse-
quently the establishment of the Tughlaq’s. There are numerous stories surrounding
the life of Nizamuddin Auliya, famous among them were stories of his confrontations
with the Sultans of Delhi. The Khwaja is said to have maintained a strict policy of not
involving himself with the various groups and factions of the Sultan’s court in Delhi
earning him the respect of many. Nasiruddin Chiragh Delhi was another of the Chishti
saints of Delhi. He played an active role in the political affairs of the period.
All these enabled Sufis to maintain a loyal and dedicated following.
In the 13 th century the Chishti Order was established in the Deccan by Shaikh
Burhanuddin Gharib. Between the 14 th and 16 th centuries many Chishti Sufis mi-
grated to Gulbarga. This was accompanied with a change where some of the Chishtis
began accepting grants and patronage from the ruling establishment. Muhammad
Banda Nawaz is among the famous pirs in the region. The Deccan city of Bijapur
emerged as an important centre for Sufi activity.
The Suhrawardi Silsilah
This Silsilah was founded by Shihabuddin Suhrawardi in Baghdad. It was established
in India by Bahauddin Zakariya. He founded the Suhrawardi Order, based in Mutan,
which was under the control of Qubacha. He was critical of Qubacha and openly
favored Iltutmish over his rival. His ways were different from that of the Chishtis. The
Suhrawardis, unlike the Chishtis, accepted, maintenance grants from the Sultans. They
believed that a Sufi should possess the three attributes of property, knowledge and hal
or mystical enlightenment. Suhrawardi saints argued that this was necessary to ensure
that they served the poor better. He stressed on the observance or external forms of
religious belief and advocated a combination of ilm (scholarship) with mysticism. Prac-
tices like bowing before the sheikh, presenting water to visitors and tonsuring the head
at the time of initiation into the Order that the Chishtis had adopted were rejected. After
his death the silsilah continued to play an important role in Punjab and Sindh.
Naqshbandi Silsilah
In India this order was established by Khwaja Bahauddin Naqshbandi. From the
beginning the mystics of this Order stressed on the observance of the shariat and"

denounced all innovations or biddat. Sheikh Baqi Billah the successor to Khawaja
Bahauddin Naqshbandi settled near Delhi, and his successor Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi
attempted to purge Islam from all liberal and what he believed were ‘un-Islamic’ prac-
tices. He opposed the listening of sama (religious music) and the practice of pilgrimage
to the tombs of saints. He opposed interaction with Hindus and Shias. He criticised the
new status accorded by Akbar to many non-Muslims, the withdrawal of the Jizyah and
the ban on cow slaughter. He believed that he was the mujaddid (renewer) of the first
millennium of Islam. He maintained that the relationship between man and God was that
between the slave and the master and not the relation of a lover and beloved. He
emphasised the individual’s unique relation of faith and responsibility to God as creator.
He tried to harmonise the doctrines of mysticism and the teachings of orthodox Islam.
The Qadri Silsilah
The Quadiriyya silsilah was popular in Punjab. Sheikh Abdul Qadir and his sons
were supporters of the Mughals under Akbar. The pirs of this Order supported the
concept of Wahdat al Wajud. Among the famous Sufis of this order was Miyan Mir
who had enrolled the Mughal princess Jahanara and her brother Dara as disciples.
The influence of the sheikh’s teachings is evident in the works of the prince. Shah
Badakhshani another pir of this silsilah while dismissing orthodox elements, declared
that, the infidel who had perceived reality and recognised it was a believer and that a
believer who did not recognise reality was an infidel.
During medieval period there was constant tension between the liberal and orthodox
views in Islam. The sufis featured on both sides, while there were those like the
Chishtis who held a liberal view and argued in favour of assimilation of local traditions
there were others like sheikh Abdul Haqq of the Qadiriyya silsilah who held the view
that the purity of Islam was being diluted. This Orthodox view was represented by the
ulema that argued from the perspective of being upholders of the shariat. The liberal
opinion found its voice among many sufis who argued against the narrow definition of
Islamic laws by the ulema.

the Brahamanical and Buddhist traditions of ancient India. It was in south India that it
grew from a religious tradition into a popular movement based on religious equality
and broad based social participation. The movement led by popular saints reached its
climax in the 10 th century A.D. In its attempt to embrace the concept of bhakti the
movement in different regions drew from diverse traditions and assumed different
forms in different parts of the sub continent.
The bhakti movement attempted to break away from orthodox Brahmanism. The
movement gathered momentum in the early medieval period. Historians have attempted
to associate the origins of the bhakti movement in India with the advent of Islam and
the spread of Sufism. They argue that the Turkish conquest paved the way for a
reaction against the conformist Rajput-Brahman domination. The rise of bhakti move-
ment is considered by some scholars as a reaction against feudal oppression. The anti
feudal tone in the poetry of bhakti saints like Kabir, Nanak, Chaitanya and Tulsidas
are seen as illustrations of this point. There is no single opinion about the origins of the
bhakti movement that can be sustained. It is clear from the poetry and the philosophy
of the bhakti saints that they broke away from orthodox Brahmanism. They believed
in religious equality and identified themselves with the sufferings of the common people.
Some scholars feel that the socio economic changes in the early medieval period
provide the necessary backdrop to understand the emergence of the Bhakti move-
ment. During the 13th and 14th centuries the demand for manufactured goods, luxuries
and other artisanal goods increased leading to a movement of artisans into the cities.
The artisans were attracted to bhakti because of its ideas of equality. These groups
were dissatisfied with the low status accorded to them by Brahmanical system. The
movement gained support from these classes of society. There were also a few varia-
tions in places like Punjab where not only Khatris but Jat peasants as were also
attracted to this movement.
The bhakti movement in the early medieval period represents an important movement
of reform and change. After the rise of heterodox movements of the 6th century BC the
bhakti movement represents another phase of Indian history in which new ideas and
practices emerged influencing the country as a whole initiating reform movements.
The Bhakti movement in north India
The bhakti movement in the north included socio religious movements that were linked to
one of the acharyas from the south and is sometimes seen as a continuation of the move-
ment that originated in the south. Though there were similarities in the traditions of the two
regions, the notion of bhakti varied in the teachings of each of the saints. The Nirguna
Bhaktas like Kabir rejected the varnaashrama and all conventions based on caste distinc-
tion and championed new values, helping the emergence of new groups and new unortho-
dox/protestant sects. The Saguna Bhaktas like Tulsidas on the other hand upheld the caste
system and the supremacy of the Brahmins. They preached religion of surrender and
simple faith in a personal god and had a strong commitment to idol worship.
Monotheistic Bhakti
Kabir (c.1440–1518 A.D.) was the earliest and most influential Bhakti saint in north
India. He was a weaver. He spent a large part of his life in Banaras. His poems were
included in the Sikh scripture, the Adi Granth. Among those who were influenced by
Kabir were Raidas, who was a tanner by caste from Banaras, Guru Nanak who was
a Khatri from Punjab and Dhanna who was a Jat peasant from Rajasthan."

 Cultural Developments in Medieval India
There are similarities in the teachings of the various monotheistic Bhakti saints in
North India.
 Most of the monotheists belonged to the low castes and were aware that there
existed a unity in their ideas. They were also aware of each other’s teachings
and influence. In their verses they mention each other and their predecessors in
a manner suggesting ideological affinity among them.
 All of them were influenced by the Vaishnava concept of Bhakti, the Nathpanthi
movement and Sufism. Their ideas seem to be a synthesis of the three traditions.
 The importance given to the personal experience of Bhakti saint with God was another
common feature among the monotheistic bhakti saints. Nirguna bhakti and not saguna
bhakti was what they believed in. They had adopted the notion of bhakti from vaishnavaism
but they gave it a nirguna orientation. Though they called God using different names and
titles their God was non-incarnate, formless, eternal and ineffable.
 The Bhakti saints refused any formal association with the organized dominant
religions of the time (Hinduism and Islam) and criticized what they regarded to
be the negative aspects of these religions. They rejected the authority of the
Brahmans and attacked the caste system and practice of idolatry.
 They composed their poems in popular languages and dialects spoken across
north India. This enabled them to transmit their ideas among the masses. It helped
their ideas to spread rapidly among the various lower classes.
Vaishnava Bhakti
In the 14th and early 15th centuries Ramananda emerged as a popular vaishnava bhakti
saint in north India. Though he was from the south he lived in Banaras because he
considered it to be the link between the South Indian bhakti and North Indian vaishnava
bhakti traditions. He looked upon Ram and not Vishnu as the object of bhakti. He
worshiped Ram and Sita and came to be identified as the founder of the Ram cult in
north India. He like the monotheist bhakti saints also rejected cast hierarchies and preached
in the local languages in his attempt to popularize the cult. His followers are called
Ramanandis. Tulsidas also championed the bhakti cause. In the early 16 century
Vallabacharya, a popular bhakti saint popularized the Krishna bhakti. Among those who
followed in his footsteps were Surdas (1483–1563) and Mira Bai (1503–1573).
The vaishnava bhakti movement in Bengal was very different form its counterparts in
north India and the south. It was influenced by the vaishnava bhakti tradition of the
Bhagavata purana and the Sahajiya Buddhist and Nathpanthi traditions. These tradi-
tions focused on esoteric and emotional aspects of devotion. In the 12 th century,
Jayadeva was an important bhakti saint in this tradition. He highlighted the mystical
dimension of love with reference to Krishna and Radha. Chaitanya was a popular
bhakti saint from the region; he was looked upon as an avatara of Krishna. Though,
he did not question the authority of the Brahmans and the scriptures. He also popular-
ized the sankirtan (group devotional songs accompanied with ecstatic dancing). With
him the bhakti movement in Bengal began to develop into a reform movement with
the notions of caste divisions that came to be questioned.
In Maharashtra the bhakti movement drew its inspiration from the Bhagavata purana
and the Siva Nathpanthis. Jnaneswar was a pioneer bhakti saint of Maharashtra. His
commentary on the Bhagavad Gita called Jnanesvari served as a foundation of the"

bhakti ideology in Maharashtra. Arguing against caste distinctions he believed that
the only way to attain God was through Bhakti. Vithoba was the God of this sect and its
followers performed a pilgrimage to the temple twice a year. The Vithoba of Pandarpur
became the mainstay of the movement in Maharashtra. Namdev (1270–1350) was
another important bhakti saint from Maharashtra. While he is remembered in the north
Indian monotheistic tradition as a nirguna saint, in Maharashtra he is considered to be
part of the varkari tradition (the vaishnava devotional tradition). Some of the other
important bhakti saints of Maharashtra were the saints Choka, Sonara, Tukaram and
Eknath. Tukaram’s teachings are in the form of the Avangas (dohas), which constitute
the Gatha, while Eknath’s teachings that were in Marathi attempted to shift the empha-
sis of Marathi literature from spiritual to narrative compositions.

The teachings and philosophy of Guru Nanak form an important part of Indian philo-

evaluated and criticized the prevailing religious beliefs and attempted to establish a
true religion, which could lead to salvation. He repudiated idol worship and did not
favour pilgrimage nor accept the theory of incarnation. He condemned formalism and
ritualism. He laid emphasis on having a true Guru for revelation. He advised people to
follow the principles of conduct and worship: sach (truth), halal (lawful earning),
khair (wishing well of others), niyat (right intention) and service to the lord. He

denounced the caste system and the inequality it caused. He argued that the caste and
honour should be judged by the acts or the deeds of individuals. He laid stress on con-
cepts of justice, righteousness and liberty. His verses mainly consist of two basic con-
cepts, Sach (truth) and Nam (name). The bases of the divine expression for him were
formed by, the Sabad (the word), Guru (the divine precept) and Hukam (the divine
order). He introduced the concept of Langar (a community kitchen). Guru Nanak iden-
tifies himself with the people or the ruled. Though the Sikh guru’s stressed on equality
the social differentiation among the followers continued. It was only towards the end of
the 17th century that Guru Gobind Singh reasserted the idea of equality. In 1699 Guru
Gobind Singh attempted to resolve the differences among the various Sikh groups and
created the Khalsa. This institution removed the masands as intermediaries. Thereafter
every Sikh was to have a direct link with the Guru. To create a sense of unity among the
Sikhs the Guru started some practices which were to be followed by Sikhs. These were
initiation through the baptism of the double edged sword, wearing uncut hair, carrying
arms, adopting the epithet Singh as part of the name.
The idea of Guru Panth was another institutional idea that emerged during this period.
It sanctified the collective authority of the Khalsa Panth, which equated the Panth
with the Guru. Guru Nanak in his last days had nominated a successor and paid
homage to him, this gave rise to the idea that the Guru and the Sikh were interchange-
able. This created a problem for the institution of the Sangat (that was a collective
body of the Sikhs) in which God was said to be present. When Guru Gobind Singh
created the Khalsa he chose the panj piyare (the five beloved) and requested them to
administer the pahul (amrit chakhha) to him. With this the difference between the
Guru and the Khalsa was symbolically removed. Guru Gobind Singh is believed to
have said that the Khalsa is his own roop (form).
Guru Nanak was from the Khatri mercantile caste whereas his followers were mostly
rural Jats. It was Guru Gobind Singh who inaugurated the Khalsa among the Sikhs.
Guru Arjan compiled the Guru Granth Sahib. After the death of Guru Gobind Singh
the tenth Guru the tradition of guru ended. It was believed that the spirit of the guru
did not pass onto any successor but instead remained within “Shri Gurugranth Sahib”.

14.4 LITERATURE AND LANGUAGES
Sanskrit literature
The medieval period witnessed the growth of a rich corpus of literature that accom-
panied the development of new languages. The conventional view among historians
was that the patronage of the Sanskrit language had declined because the establish-
ment of the Delhi Sultanate led to the patronage of Persian. But this period witnessed
the growth of a rich corpus of Sanskrit literature. This period is marked with compo-
sition of poetical works called the Kavya (poetical narrative) and the texts that codi-
fied laws called the Dhramashastras."

HISTORY
 Cultural Developments in Medieval India
During the first half of the medieval period Sanskrit received patronage from the
numerous smaller political establishments in central and south India. In western India
Hemachandra Suri was an important Jain scholar who composed works in Sanskrit,
as was Chaitanya. There were also many dramas written during this period. A new
style of writing called the champu also emerged during this period. It was a form that
mixed both prose and poetry. Among the Sanskrit works that were written with the
patronage of the Rajput kings were their family histories like the Prithvirajavijaya
and the Hammirmahakavya. Among the historical poems of the period was the
Rajavinoda that was a biography of Sultan Mahmud Begarha of Gujarat written by
his court poet, Udayaraja. Another important work was Kalhan’s Rajtarangini, which
presented a history of the kings of Kashmir. It was written in the 12 th century A.D.
The second Rajtaranginni was written by Jonaraja who wrote the history of the
kings of Kashmir from Jayasimha to Sultan Zainul Abidin and the third was written by
Srivara who wrote the history of the region till 1486. Apart from these there were the
prabandhas which were semi historical texts written during the period.
After the 15th century the patronage of the Sanskrit language was maintained in the
southern courts of the rulers of Vijayanagar, Nayakas of Tanjor and the chiefs of
Travancore and Cochin. The various genres of Sanskrit literature like Mahakavyas,
Slesh Kavyas, Champu Kavyas, Natakas and the historical Kavyas continued. Among
the important writers of this period were Govinda Dikshita ( Sahitya Sudha  and
Sangitsudhanidhi being among his important works); Appaya Dikshita (in the court
of the Nayaka ruler of Vellore); Nilanatha Dikshit (who was a minister in the court of
the Nayaka of Madurai); Chakrakavi (who was patronized by the rulers of Kozhikode).
The historical Kavyas gave a glimpse not just of the exploits of the various rulers but
also a glimpse of the social perception of the writers. Some of the Mughals like Dara
Shukoh also came to be mentioned in these Kavyas. The Mughal prince is also cred-
ited with the composition of a prasasti in honour of Nrisimha Sarasvati of Benaras.
There were also a few works composed in the courts of the rulers of Bijapur and
Golconda, but Sanskrit literature during this period began to decline.
Persian literature
With the establishment of the Delhi sultanate a new language and literary style was
introduced into the sub continent.
The development of Persian literature in the sub continent entered a new era in the
writings of Amir Khusrau. He was a poet born in a family of Turkish immigrants and
began as a poet in the reign of Sultan Balban. He was a disciple of Nizamuddin Auliya
and was patronized in the courts of Jalaluddin Khalji, Alauddin Khalji and Ghiyasuddin
Tughluq. He is said to have composed ninety-nine works on different themes and
numerous verses of poetry. His poetry was written in the different forms of lyric, ode,
epic and elegy. His writing style represents the first instance of Persian styles being
composed in the Indian context. This came to be known as the Sabaq-i-Hindi (the
Indian style). Among the important works composed by him are, Mutla-ul-Anwar,
Shirin Khusrau, Laila Majnun  and Ayina-I-Sikandari , these works were dedi-
cated to Alauddin Khalji. Amorig his five Diwans (Ghazals) are Tuhfat-us-Sighar,
Baqiya Naqiya and Nihayat-ul-Kamal. He also wrote masnavis (narrative poems),
which have been of great historical and literary value. Among these are the Qiran-us
Sa’dain, Miftah-ul Futuh (dealing with the military success of Jalauddin Khalji),
Tughluq Nama  (describing Ghiyasuddin Tughluq’s rise to power) and the"

Khazain-ul Futuh (giving an account of Alauddin Khalji’s conquest of the South). Among
the other important Persian poets was Shaikh Najmuddin Hasan who was also one of the
poets in the court of Alauddin Khalji. His ghazals earned him the title, S’aid of Hindustan.
The court chronicles were an important feature of the literature during the period of
the Delhi Sultanate. Some important of these were, the Tabaqat-I-Nasiri by Minaj-us
Siraj, Futuh-us Salatin by Isami and the Futuhat-I Firozshahi by Feroz Shah Tughluq.
Ziauddin Barani made the most important contribution to Persian literature during this
period. The Tarikh-I Firozshahi and the Fatwa-I Jahandari are his important works.
The Sufi literature of the period developed a new form called the malfuzat that was in
the form of a dialogue of the Sufi saints. The most famous of these was the Fawaid-ul
Fu’ad written by Amir Hassan Sijzi containing the anecdotes of the Shaikh Nizamuddin
Auliya and Khair-ul-Majalis containing the anecdotes of Sheik Nasiruddin Mahmud.
During this period there were many works that were translated into Persian. The Tuti
Nama (book of the parrot) by Zia Nakshabi was the first Persian translation of Sanskrit
stories. The Mahabharatha and the Rajtarangini were also translated into Persian
during this period. The number of translations of Sanskrit works into Persian grew
during the reigns of Feroz Tughluq and Sikandar Lodi.
Like that of the sultanate, Persian also continued as the official language of the Mughal
court. The Mughal rulers and princes also maintained a tradition of writing. The first
Mughal emperor Babur, himself a literary figure, wrote his memoirs in Turkish which was
subsequently translated into Persian by Abdur Rahim Khan Khanan. Humayun composed
a Persian diwan. Prince Dara Shukoh wrote a biographical account of the Sufi saint Miya
Mir and his disciples in the Sakinatul Auliya. He also wrote the Majm’aul Bahrain
(Mingling of two Oceans). There was a new genre of Persian literature known as the
Sabaq-i-Hindi (the Indian style) created during this period by the Persian poets visiting
and living in the sub continent. Writers like Faizi, Urfi, Talib, Ghani Kashmiri and Bedil
were among those who benefited from the patronage they received from the Mughals.
Among the important works of Faizi was Tabashir al Sabh. He also authored many
translations of Hindu religious books. Abdur Rahim Khan Khana a talented scholar
and poet lived during the reign of Akbar and Jahangir. Akbar patronized great scholar
historian Abul Fazl. He is said to have maintained a library of more than four thousand
books. He is known for the patronage he extended to many writers of the period. The
poets Ali Quli Salem and Abu Talib Kalim were important poets during the reign of
Shah Jahan. The latter is said to have authored the Padshahnama. Persian literature
in the south received patronage from the Adil Shahi rulers of Bijapur, here Malik
Qummi and Mulla Zuhuri were regarded as important Persian poets. The Qutab Shahis
of Golconda patronized poets like Muhammad Hussain Tabrezi. The development of
Persian literature in the Mughal court played an important role and influenced the
development and growth of regional literature. Languages like Punjabi, Pushtu, Sindhi
and Kashmiri were strongly influenced by Persian.
Growth and Development of Regional Languages
The growth of regional languages like Hindi, Bengali, Assamese, Oriya, Marathi and Gujarati
during the medieval period was an important development. These languages can be traced
to the 7th and 8th centuries when they seem to have broken away from their Prakrit base.
In the south Malayalam emerged as an independent language in the 14th century. The
growth of these regional languages coincided with a growing regional sentiment and the
emergence of regional polities. This resulted in the decline of Sanskrit that was being
replaced by Persian and some of these regional languages as a medium through which the"

administrative machinery functioned. The rise of the Bhakti movement and its propagation
using these languages also enabled the growth and development of these languages.
Hindi and Urdu
Regional dialects like Braj bhasa, Haryanvi and other dialects spoken in regions around
Delhi and Punjab influenced the development of Urdu during its formative stage. The
basic structure of the language consisted of Khari Boli (a mixture of various dialects
spoken in the region mentioned above). The language adopted the Persian script and
literary tradition. The word Urdu is of Turkish origin referring to an army or camp. It
seems to have been a language that emerged from the dialect spoken in the Turkish
camp between officials and the soldiers. Hindivi is said to be the language out of which
Urdu and Hindi eventually developed. The works of Amir Khusrau are regarded to
have laid the foundations of this language. The use of this language in the Deccan from
the 14th century onwards led to a literary speech called the Dakhni. The major centres
of this language were Gujarat, Bijapur, Golconda, Bidar and Aurangabad. The oldest
writer of this tradition was Sayyid Banda Nawaz Gesudaraz who was an important Sufi
in the Bahmani kingdom. The sultan of Bijapur, Ibrahim Adil Shah II himself was a great
patron and author of a book on music in the Dakhni language.
Hindi evolved during the Apabhransa stage between the 7 th – 8th centuries and the
14th century. It was characterized as Veergatha Kala (age of heroic poetry) or the
Adi Kala (early Period). The various Rajput rulers patronized these poems written in
the rajasthani dialect of Hindi and that glorified chivalry and bravery. Among the
famous works are the Prithviraja Raso of Chand Bardai, and other poems like the
Visaldeva Raso  and Hammir Raso . The authenticity of many of these works is
doubted because of the various interpolations made to the original draft. There are
other works of Buddhists and Jains that can be ascribed to this period.
The development of the Hindi language underwent another transformation during the 14th
and the 15 centuries with the increasing use of the language in expressing Bhakti traditions
and ideas. Kabir adopted a style called the ultabasi, which consisted of paradoxes and
enigmas. While bhakti saints like Tulsidas used the Awadhi dialect of Hindi others like Mira
Bai used the Marwari dialect of Rajasthan and Surdas used Braj bhasha. The Sufi saints
also used the development of the new dialects as a medium to reach out to a larger audience.
While the Chishti saints used Hindi while composing and singing their devotional music.
Bengali
The folksongs called Charyapads composed between the 10 and 12th centuries are
the earliest specimen of the Bengali language. The works of Kavindra and Srikaranandi
are regarded to be among the important early works in Bengali. The growth of the
Bhakti movement and the composition of various hymns associated with Chaitanya
further provided a stimulus to the development of this language. Brindabandas’s
Chaitanya Bhagavata or Chaitanya Mangal was one such contribution to Bengali
literature that not only gave a valuable account of the saint’s death a decade later but
is also regarded as being reflective of the social condition prevailing at that time. The
Chaitanya-Charitamrita by Krishnadas Kaviraj was another important account.
Lochandas is associated with the introduction of a new style of folk songs called
Dhamali. Narrative poems called the Mangal Kavyas also grew popular during this
period. They propagated the importance of local deities like Chandi and transformed
Puranic gods like Siva and Vishnu into household deities. The narrative form of the
Mangal Kavyas was derived from the Puranas."

 Cultural Developments in Medieval India
Asamese and Oriya
The 13th century works of Hema Sarasvati Prahladacharita and Hara Gauri Samyada
are regarded as the first works in Assamese. The literature in Assam also developed
in response to the bhakti movement. Shankaradeva who introduced Vaisnavism in
Assam also helped stimulate the growth of Assamese poetry. His disciple, Madhavadas
wrote the Bhakti-ratnvali dealing with aspects of bhakti and the Baragitas that
depicted the life of Krishna in Vrindavan. There were also translations of the Puranas
into Assamese. In Orissa the works of Saraladasa are regarded as the first works of
Oriya literature. There were numerous kavyas composed on Puranic themes by
Madhusudana, Bhima and Sasasiva. The Rasa Kallol written during this period also
deals on the theme of the love between Radha and Krishna. Other important works
are the Ushabhilasa of Sisu Sankara Dasa and the Rukminibibha of Kartik Dasa. The
works of Upendra Bhanja (1670–1720) were important as they ushered a new era of
Oriya literature in the succeeding period.
Literature in South India
In the south Villiputturar was an important literary figure of the period. The tradition
of using Sanskrit words and literary expressions is ascribed to him. Other important
works in Tamil are commentaries written by Vaishnava scholars and also commen-
taries on works of the sangam age like the Tolkappiyam and the Kural. There were
also a number of philosophical works and commentaries that were written on the
Puranas. Many of the works in Tamil literature were related to Shaivism and
Vaishnavism. Among the important works of the medieval period was the Irusamaya-
vilakkam written by Haridasa, the Sivadarumottaram and the Saiva Samayaneri
both written by Marainanarbandar. In the realm of philosophy the notable works were
the Cidambarapuranam  (1508) by Purana Tirumalainathan and the
Palanittalapuranam by Balasubramanya Kavirayar.
During this period the most famous Telugu poet was Errapragada who popularized
the Champu genre of literary writing (mixed form of verse and prose). He also trans-
lated the Bhagavata Purana into Telugu. The Vijayanagar ruler Krishnadeva Raya
wrote the Amuktamalyada in Telugu. The most celebrated poet in his court was
Allarrani Peddana and Nandi Timmaha who wrote the Parijatapaharana. Bhattumurti
or Rama Raja Bhushan is known for the Vasucaritra and the Hariscandra
Nalopakhyanam (that narrates the story of Nala and Raja Harishchandra). In the
Kannada speaking regions Jain writers dominated the literary compositions of the
period. The works of Basava and his followers who popularized the Virasaiva move-
ment in the region also form an important aspect of Kannada literature. The patron-
age of the Hoysala rulers further helped the development of the language. The Vadi
Vidyananda of Geroppa is an anthology of Kannada poets. The Jain scholar Salva
wrote works like the Trilokararara (on cosmology), Aparajiyasataka (on Philoso-
phy) and the Bharataesvaracarita (the story of the famous king Bharata). Malayalam
emerged as an independent language during this period. The language was in oral
form and the earliest work composed in the 14 th century was the Rama Charitam.
The works of Rama Panikkar who wrote Bharata Gatha, Savitri Mahatmyam and
the Bhagavatam are considered important in malayalam.

14.5 MUSIC
Information on music of the sultanate period is limited. The important phase in the
development of music during this period belongs to the time of Amir Khusrau. It is
during this period that the qawwali style is said to have developed. He is also credited
for the development of many modern ragas like aiman, gora and sanam . He is
credited with the creation of a new musical instrument, the sitar that was a combina-
tion of the Indian vina and the Iranian tambura. The Turks are credited with bringing
musical instruments like rabab and sarangi into South Asia. In Vrindavan Swami
Haridas promoted music and is considered to have taught Tansen who was at the
court of the Mughal emperor Akbar. Tansen is regarded as an important exponent of
the Hindustani classical music and is credited with introducing ragas as the Miyan ki
Malhar, Miyan ki Todi and Darbari. Raja Mansingh is said to have played an impor-
tant role in the perfection of the Dhrupad style of North Indian Music. In the south a
system of ragas known as the Janaka and Janya ragas existed during this period. The
Swaramela Kalanidhi by Ramamatya of Kondavidu written in 1550 describes 20
Janan and 64 Janya ragas. By the 18 th century several new forms of music like
Tarana, Dadra and Ghazal had come into existence.
14.6 PAINTINGS
The developments in painting during the sultanate period have not been studied be-
cause of the limited samples. The closest view that one has of murals in the sultanate
is to the numerous literary references. The earliest reference to murals is in a qasida
in praise of Iltutmish, which describes the figures depicted upon the sqandrels of the
main arch that was raised to welcome the envoy of the Caliph. In another reference
in the Tarikh-I Ferozshai there is a reference to the Sultan seeking to ban the tradi-
tion of figural paintings on the walls of the palaces of Delhi. Quaranic calligraphy also
became popular across South Asia during this period. The earliest copy of the Quran
(dated 1399) was written in Gwalior. The manuscript was decorated with a variety of
ornamental motifs. By the 15th century the kingdoms of Gujarat, Malwa and Jaunpur
emerged as important centres of art.
Paintings in medieval India entered a new phase under the Mughals. They altered the
character of painting across north India. The Mughal paintings are defined by the
styles and subjects popular at the imperial court. The early origins of the Mughal
School of painting can be traced to Kabul. During the reign of Humayun two Persian
artists, Mir Syed Ali and Abdus Samad were patronized."

Akbar deputed them to illustrate manuscript of Hamzanama. This manuscript of
1,400 pages was compiled by artists drawn from Gwalior, Gujarat, Lahore and Kash-
mir. It is during this period that many features of Mughal painting developed. Many
paintings of this period are collaborative efforts with two or even four painters work-
ing on one painting. Among the important features of the paintings of this period are
restricted movement of the figures, fineness of lines of drawings and flat depiction of
architectural columns. The Mughal paintings are also marked with a naturalism and
rhythm, the clothing of the objects assumed Indian forms and the use of subsidiary
scenes in the background. The two most common themes in Mughal paintings of this
period are specific events in the court and the portraits of leading personalities.
During the reign of Jahangir there were other changes in the style of Mughal paintings.
The paintings of the Jahangir period accentuate a formalist style and have broad mar-
gins which are well decorated with the depiction of flora and faces of human figures,
the naturalistic representations matured during the reign of Jahangir. The use of trees,
birds, streams and rivers in the backdrop of the paintings became very popular.

There are interesting scenes of love and portraits of women members attached to the
royal court in Mughal paintings of the Shah Jahan period, while the paintings of the Aurangzeb
period provide glimpses of the Mughal emperor during his campaigns. As in architecture
the Mughal paintings also gave way to the growth and development of regional styles that
tried to replicate the same features and characteristic decorative designs.
Rajput paintings that are also of the same period consist of various different court
styles, corresponding to the various Rajput kingdoms. The Rajput paintings during the
16th and 17th centuries used many representations of mythology and of court scenes.
The Rajput paintings are spread over a larger geographical region, with each region
forming a separate sub topic in the artistic scheme. The other styles that were popular
were the regional styles of the Deccan and the regions of Bengal, Gujarat and Orissa.
The Rajput paintings further flourished in the eighteenth century when many of the
artists shifted to the courts of their new patrons. This also coincided with the emer-
gence of many smaller regional styles of paintings. These paintings are known for the
intensity of the colours that they use and depict hunting scenes, portraits of individuals
and of musical sessions. The main styles of this painting were the Mewar, Bundi and
the Kishangarh schools.

14.7 ARCHITECTURE
Architecture of the Delhi Sultanate
New architectural forms and styles were introduced in India during the medieval period.
The arch and dome were new architectural additions of the period. The use of lime-mortar
in the construction of buildings and houses altered the building techniques. The develop-
ment of the true arch was important feature of the architectural style of the period. The
true arch required stones and bricks to be laid as voussoirs in the shape of a curve and
bound together firmly by a good binding material. The arches were made in different
shapes but the dominant one was the pointed form. In the 14th century a variant of the
arch, called the four-centred arch was introduced by the Tughluqs in their buildings.
There are only a few instances of early Turkish buildings in the sub continent where
newly quarried material has been employed. In most of the buildings of the period the
richly carved capitals, columns and shafts of older buildings are reused. Stone has
been used abundantly in the masonry work of this period. The material commonly
used for plastering buildings was gypsum. Apparently lime-plaster was reserved for
places that needed to be secured against water leakage as in roofs, canals and drains.
In the later period gypsum mortar became popular in buildings.
Here we will provide you a brief account of medieval architecture during the Sultan-
ate Mughal and the regional styles which developed in India during medieval period.

 Cultural Developments in Medieval India
The Sultanate Period
Monuments like the Quwwatul Islam mosque (1198), Qutab Minar (1199–1235),
Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra (1200) and Iltutmish’s tomb represent the early forms of Indo-
Islamic architecture. The early buildings show signs of being worked upon by local crafts-
men while the later buildings show the development or the maturing of the Indo-Islamic
style. In these monuments one can see the gradual development of dome and the true
arch. The best examples of this are the tombs of Iltutmish (1233–34) and Balban (1287–
88). The Alai Darwaza in the Qutub complex (1305) and the Jamat Khana Masjid at
Nizamuddin (1325) are examples of Khalji period. Here one notices changes marked by
the distinct influence of the Seljuq architectural tradition. The employment of the true arch
shaped like a pointed horse shoe; the emergence of true dome; use of red sand stone and
decorative marble reliefs; the emergence of the lotus bud fringe on the underside of the
arch and the new masonry were the important features of this new style. The new
architectural style of the Tughluq period is represented with the use of stone rubble as the
principle building material, the battering of walls and bastions, a new type of arch called
the four centred arch, the emergence of the pointed dome and the introduction of an
octagonal plan of tomb building. Another important feature of Tughlaq architecture was
the “batter” or sloping walls. This gave the structures an effcct of strength. During the
subsequent period numerous tombs were built using the octagonal plan while others were
built using the square plan. The Architectural monuments of the Sur’s can be divided into
two periods, the first with buildings at Sasaram (1530–40) like the tombs of Sher Shah’s
father and Sher Shah himself. The second phase from (1540–45) is represented by build-
ings like the Purana Qila in Delhi and the Qilai Kuhna Masjid inside the Qila. The slight
flatness in the curve towards the crown is indicative of the last stage before the develop-
ment of the four-centred arch developed during the Mughal phase.
Regional Variations
During this period there was a development of various regional architectural forms. In
eastern India there was the development of two distinctive schools in Bengal and in
Jaunpur. The most prominent buildings of the Bengal school belong to the Malda district in
the remains of the two cities, Gaur and Pandua. Here there is an introduction of two
important features. The first was the ‘drop arch’, which had a span greater than its radius
and centres at the import level. The second was the method of raising the roof in a system
of arched bays where small domes supported by diagonally arranged brick pendentives
that helped transition from a square to a circular base. Another development in this period
was the transition from constructing bamboo houses to brick structures, during which a
special form of a curved roof developed. The best illustrations of the architecture styles
from Jaunpur are the mosques. The styles here bear close resemblance to the Tughlaq
style. The use of the arch and beam are notable features of this style.
In western India the development of regional architectural forms is notable in 14th century
Gujarat. Here there is a distinctive change in the art form from the 14th into the 15thcentury.
In the former there was a large scale use of building material from demolished temples and
in the latter there is a development of a new style in which the layout of the mosques copied
the architectural imprint of temples. In central India the development of new art forms is
noticeable in the Malwa region; the cities of Dhar and Mandu are illustrations of this style.
Another important region that developed its distinctive style was the Deccan where
the Bahmani kingdom created a very different architectural style as compared to the
northern architectural forms. The Deccan style developed with the fusion of the
Tughlaq style from the north and the Iranian style. The development of the"

Notes
 Cultural Developments in Medieval India
architectural style here coincides with the shifting of the kingdom’s capital from
Gulbarga (1347) to Bidar (1425) and eventually to Golconda (1512). In the first phase
in Gulbarga the architectural style is representative of a distinctive Islamic architec-
ture that followed the Tughlaq style. In the second phase there is an adaptation of
Iranian architectural styles, this is accompanied with the use of coloured tiles, mural
paintings and a change in the shape of the domes.
Another important regional development in the Deccan was Vijayanagara art. The
distinctive style is best illustrated using the architectural forms in the city of Hampi.
Besides palaces and temples the city also had an extensive network of waterworks and
public buildings such as the elephant stables and the Lotus Mahal. The unique features
of this style were the use of pillars for architectural and decorative purposes. The
climax of temple architecture at Vijayanagara occurred under the Tuluva rulers. The
architectural tradition was accompanied by a vibrant sculptural tradition that used many
mythological figures and narratives. The shrines on Hemakuta hill, Virupaksha temple
and the Hazara Rama temple are examples of Vijayanagara temple architecture.
The Architecture of the Mughal Empire
This period witnessed large scale architectural activities that represented the peak of
Islamic art in India. It was also a period where there was a great exchange of ideas
and styles that led to the creation of a style that was very different from the Sultanate
period and that had many features of local or regional styles. The Mughal Emperor
Akbar initiated the grand projects that symbolize this period.
Among the early structures of this period are the two mosques built by Babur at
Sambhal and Panipat in 1526. Babur is also credited with the laying out of gardens at
Dholpur and at Ram Bagh and Zahra Bagh at Agra. Two mosques one at Agra and
the other at Hissar belong to the reign of the second Mughal emperor Humayun. The
grandness of Mughal architecture began with the construction of Humayun’s tomb
and its design by Mirak Mirza Ghiyas from Persia. He brought with him Persian
craftsmen to work on the tomb. This tomb is the earliest specimen of a garden enclo-
sure and is raised on an arcaded sandstone platform. The tomb is octagonal and

crowned by a high dome. The dome is a double dome, which is built in two layers one
which provides the ceiling to the interior of the building and the other, which provides
the outer layer that crowns, the building.
During the reign of Akbar many indigenous styles were encouraged leading to the
common use of sandstone, the use of arches (mainly in a decorative form) and the
decoration that comprised mainly of boldly carved or inlaid patterns complemented by
brightly coloured patterns on the interiors. Among the important monumental projects
undertaken was the building of Agra fort, within the fort were many structures that
were built in the Gujarat and Bengal styles, which were subsequently demolished by
Shah Jahan who remodelled the fort and its interiors. The Janangir Mahal  conceived as
a robust building in red sandstone, is a fusion of Hindu and Islamic building designs. The
combination of beam and bracket form the principal structural system, the same styles
are seen in the palace fortresses of Lahore and Allahabad. Mughal architecture under
Akbar entered a new phase with the construction of Fatehpur Sikri. This city-palace
was built entirely of red sandstone between 1571–1585. The buildings could be studied
under two categories, religious and secular. Among the religious buildings are, the Jami
Masjid, the Buland Darwaza and the tombs of Shaikh Salim Chishti. The secular struc-
tures are the palaces, administrative buildings and other structures. The Jama Masjid
uses a typical plan of a mosque with a central courtyard, arcades on three sides and a
domed skyline. In its courtyard lies the tomb of Salim Chishti. Among the palaces are
buildings known as the Jodh Bai palace, the Panch Mahal (the size of this five storey
structure that diminishes as one goes higher), the Diwan-i-Khas (is in the form of a
rectangle and is two stories from outside) and the Diwan-i- Am. Among the other
buildings here are the Hathi Pol and the Karkhana buildings.
The important buildings of the reigns of Jahangir include the Tomb of Akbar at Sikandara,
and the tomb of Itmad ud Daula. The tomb at Sikandara is designed as a tomb

 enclosure enclosed by a garden, the tomb itself is three stories high the first being an arcaded
platform making the basement the middle portion is in three tiers of red sandstone while the
highest one is made of white marble which is open on top with a screen surrounding it. The
tomb of Itmad ud Daula built in 1622–28 marks a change in architectural style from the
Akbari period. This enclosed tomb with a dome roof is enclosed with a beautiful marble
tracery. Jahangir is also known to have laid the famous Mughal gardens in Kashmir.
Among the important monuments of the reign of Shah Jahan are the Lal Qila (in Delhi),
the Moti Masjid (at Agra), the Jami Masjid in Delhi and the Taj Mahal. The Lal Qila is
designed as a rectangle along the banks of the river Yamuna. There are two gates, the
Delhi and Lahore gates. There is a moat that runs all along the fort except on the
riverside. The important buildings inside the fort are the Diwan-i-Am, Diwan-i-Khas
and the Rang Mahal. The Moti Masjid in Agra was an experiment with an alternative
scheme of an open prayer hall that had also dispensed with the minarets and replaced
them with chhatris on the four coners of the prayer hall. The Jammi Masjid is a larger
version of the Jammi Masjid in Fathepur Sikri. It is built on a large platform; within the
mosque there are colonnades on three sides with the sanctuary along the fourth. There
are three marble domes rising above the sanctuary. The Taj Mahal represents the grandest
project of Shahjahan. The construction of the Taj began in 1632 and was completed by
1643. The plan of the complex is rectangle with a high enclosure wall and a lofty gate-
way in the middle. The main building of the Taj stands on a high marble platform at the
northern end of the enclosure. There is a huge dome that covers the top of this struc-
ture, with an inverted lotus finial. The decorative features of the building consist mainly
of calligraphy and inlay work in the exterior and pietra dura in the interior.
The Moti Masjid at Lal Qila in Delhi, the Badshahi Masjid in Lahore and the mausoleum built
for his wife Rabia ud Dauran at Aurangabad are the main examples of Mughal architecture
under Aurangzeb. The mausoleum at Aurangabad was modeled on the Taj Mahal. Of archi-
tectural monuments after Aurangzeb the tomb of Safdar Jang in Delhi is representative of
the continuation of the tradition of the Mughals by the regional governors.

Decorative Styles
Another feature of the art of this period was the decorative art in Islamic buildings
that was introduced in the sub continent for the first time. These decorative styles
were usually in the form of calligraphy, geometrical figures and foliation. In calligra-
phy quranic sayings were inscribed on buildings in an angular, sober and monumental
script called kufi. The calligraphy was found on different parts of the buildings as on
doorframes, ceilings, wall panels, etc. The geometric shapes on the other hand were
used in different variety of combinations. The generating source of these designs was
the circle, which was then developed into a square, triangle or polygon. These forms
were then elaborated by, multiplication and sub division, by rotating and by symmetri-
cal arrangements. Of the flotations, the dominant form of decoration employed in the
sultanate buildings was the arabesque. It was characterized by a continuous stem
that split regularly, producing a series of leafy secondary stems which split again to
reintegrate into the main stem.

WHAT YOU HA VE LEARNT
The medieval Indian culture represents the synthesis of Indian and Persian philoso-
phy, literature art and architecture. In religious sphere Sufism and Bhakti tradition
influenced each other. They provided an opportunity for understanding religious tradi-
tions of Hindus and Muslims at people’s level.
The emergence of Urdu as a new language is a best example of interaction and
synthesis. The same is visible in the area of Music and Painting. In the field of archi-
tecture, the form, style and decoration take a lot from each other.
The medieval period thus represents an important era of dramatic change in the
world of religion and art in South Asia. The growing popularity of Sufism played an
important role in the popular acceptability of Islam and in the course establishing
unique Islamic tradition in the sub continent. The Bhakti movement played a similar
role in the development of Hinduism. On one hand it challenged existing religious and"

social hierarchies and on the other it revived concepts like monotheism in mainstream
Hindu tradition. Both the Sufi and Bhakti movements questioned the authority of the
established clergy and the relevance of established religious rituals. Importantly while
both emerged questioning established religious traditions they eventually found them-
selves being integrated into established religious systems.
Another important development during the medieval period was the growth in vernacular
literature. Growing regional identities helped create new literary and art forms. The growth
in regional languages like Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi and Telugu was a very significant
development. The popularity of translations further widened readership and helped in the
exchange of ideas. The exchange of ideas also ushered new development in music. The
use of the Sitar and new styles of music further enriched the medieval period.
In the realm of art one witnesses the development of new styles of painting associ-
ated with the patronage of the Mughal and the Rajput style There was a change in the
character and stylistic representation seen in earlier periods. The synthesis of the
medieval period is best seen in the development of new architectural styles. The large
number of forts, palaces, temples and Mosques that can be dated to this period are
examples of the new styles. The use of decorative motifs and the adaptation of the
dome are examples of the architectural traditions of this period.

UNDERSTANDING EIGHTEENTH
CENTURY INDIA
15
Notes
The eighteenth century in India was characterized by two critical transitions which
altered the structure of power and initiated important social and economic changes.
The first was the transition in the first half of the century from the Mughal Empire to
the regional political orders. The second was the transition in the polity, society and
economy. In the 18th century English East India Company steered its way to position
of political dominance. The decline of the Mughal authority gave rise to the emer-
gence of a number of independent kingdoms. In this chapter we will study the emer-
gence of these independent kingdoms in different parts of the country. The aggres-
sive British policies affected the economic situation. The agricultural and non agricul-
tural production was altered. The commercial activities also underwent changes. These
will also be discussed in the chapter. The social and cultural scenario of 18th century
will also be analysed.
OBJECTIVES
After studying this lesson, you will be able to:
 explain causes of the fall of the Mughal Empire and rise of the regional polities;
 give an account of major political powers that emerged during this period;
 distinguish the regional variations within the Indian economy of the period;
 identify the features of society and culture in the 18th century and
 list the issues involved in understanding the eighteenth century.
15.1 DECLINE OF THE MUGHAL EMPIRE
The Background
The unity and stability of the Mughal Empire was shaken during the long and strong
reign of Emperor Aurangzeb. However, in spite of setbacks and adverse circum-
stances the Mughal administration was still quite efficient and the Mughal army strong
at the time of his death in 1707. This year is generally considered to separate the era
of the great Mughals from that of the lesser Mughals. After the death of Aurangzeb
the Mughal authority weakened, it was not in a position to militarily enforce its regu-
lations in all parts of the empire. As a result many provincial governors started to
assert their authority. In due course of time they gained independent status. At the
same time many kingdoms which were subjugated by the Mughals also claimed their
indepence. Some new regional groups also consolidated and emerged as political"

power with all these developments, the period between 1707 and 1761 (third battle of Panipat,
where Ahmed Shah Abdali defeated the Maratha chiefs) witnessed resurgence of regional
identity that buttressed both political and economic decentralization. At the same time,
intraregional as well as interregional trade in local raw materials, artifacts, and grains created
strong ties of economic interdependence, irrespective of political and military relations.
Passing of the Mughal Empire
In 1707, when Aurangzeb died, serious threats from the peripheries had begun to
accentuate the problems at the core of the empire. The new emperor, Bahadur Shah
I (or Shah Alam; ruled 1707–12), followed a policy of compromise, pardoning all
nobles who had supported his rivals. He granted them appropriate territories and
postings. He never abolished jizya, but the effort to collect the tax were not effec-
tive. In the beginning he tried to gain greater control over the Rajput states of the rajas
of Amber (later Jaipur) and Jodhpur. When his attempt met with firm resistance he
realized the necessity of a settlement with them. However, the settlement did not
restore them to fully committed warriors for the Mughal cause. The emperor’s policy
toward the Marathas was also that of half-hearted conciliation. They continued to
fight among themselves as well as against the Mughals in the Deccan. Bahadur Shah
was, however, successful in conciliating Chatrasal, the Bundela chief, and Churaman,
the Jat chief; the latter also joined him in the campaign against the Sikhs.
Jahandar Shah (ruled 1712–13) was a weak and ineffective ruler. His wazir Zulfiqar
Khan assumed the executive direction of the empire with unprecedented powers.
Zulfiqar believed that it was necessary to establish friendly relations with the Rajputs
and the Marathas and to conciliate the Hindu chieftains in general in order to save the
empire. He reversed the policies of Aurangzeb. The hated jizya was abolished. He
continued the old policy of suppression against the Sikhs. His goal was to reconcile all
those who were willing to share power within the Mughal institutional framework.
Zulfiqar Khan made several attempts at reforming the economic system.
He failed in his efforts to enhance the revenue collection of the state. When Farrukh
Siyar, son of the slain prince Azimush-Shan, challenged Jahandar Shah and Zulfiqar
Khan with a large army and funds from Bihar and Bengal, the rulers found their
coffers depleted. In desperation, they looted their own palaces, even ripping gold and
silver from the walls and ceilings, in order to finance an adequate army. Farrukh Siyar
(ruled 1713–19) owed his victory and accession to the Sayyid brothers, Abdullah
Khan and Husain Ali Khan Baraha. The Sayyids thus earned the offices of wazir and
chief bakhshi and acquired control over the affairs of state. They promoted the
policies initiated earlier by Zulfiqar Khan. Jizya and other similar taxes were immedi-
ately abolished. The brothers finally suppressed the Sikh revolt and tried to conciliate
the Rajputs, the Marathas, and the Jats. However, this policy was hampered by divi-
siveness between the wazir and the emperor, as the groups tended to ally themselves
with one or the other. The Jats once again started plundering the royal highway be-
tween Agra and Delhi. Farrukh Siyar deputed Raja Jai Singh to lead a punitive cam-
paign against them but wazir negotiated a settlement over the raja’s head. As a result,
throughout northern India zamindars either revolted violently or simply refused to
pay assessed revenues. On the other hand, Farrukh Siyar compounded difficulties in
the Deccan by sending letters to some Maratha chiefs urging them to oppose the
forces of the Deccan governor, who happened to be the deputy and an associate of
Sayyid Husain Ali Khan. Finally, in 1719, the Sayyid brothers brought
Ajit Singh of Jodhpur and a Maratha force to Delhi to depose the emperor."

HISTORY
 Understanding Eighteenth Century India
The murder of Farrukh Siyar created a wave of revulsion against the Sayyids among
the various factions of nobility, who were also jealous of their growing power. Many
of these, in particular the old nobles of Aurangzeb’s time, resented the wazir’ s en-
couragement of revenue farming, which in their view was mere shop keeping and
violated the age- old Mughal notion of statecraft. In Farrukh Siyar’s place the broth-
ers raised to the throne three young princes in quick succession within eight months in
1719. Two of these, Rafi- ud- Darajat and Rafi- ud- Dawlah (Shah Jahan II), died of
consumption. The third, who assumed the title of Muhammad Shah, exhibited suffi-
cient vigour to set about freeing himself from the brothers’ control.
A powerful group under the leadership of the Nizam-ul-Mulk, Chin Qilich Khan, and
his father’s cousin Muhammad Amin Khan, the two eminent nobles emerged finally to
dislodge the Sayyid brothers (1720). By the time Muhammad Shah (ruled 1719–48)
came to power, the nature of the relationship between the emperor and the nobility had
almost completely changed. Individual interests of the nobles had come to guide the
course of politics and state activities. In 1720 Muhammad Amin Khan replaced Sayyid
Abdullah Khan as wazir; after Amin Khan’s death (January 1720), the office was
occupied by the Nizam-ul-Mulk for a brief period until Amin Khan’s son Qamar-ud-Din
Khan assumed the title in July 1724 by a claim of hereditary right. The nobles them-
selves virtually dictated these appointments. By this time the nobles had assumed lot of
powers. They used to get farmans issued in the name of emperor in their favours. The
position of emperor was preserved as a symbol only without real powers. The real
powers seated with important groups of nobles. The nobles in control of the central
offices maintained an all-empire outlook, even if they were more concerned with the
stability of the regions where they had their jagirs. Farmans (mandates granting cer-
tain rights or special privileges) to governors, faujdar, and other local officials were
sent, in conformity with tradition, in the name of the emperor. Individual failings of
Aurangzeb’s successors also contributed to the decline of royal authority. Jahandar
Shah lacked dignity and decency; Farrukh Siyar was fickle-minded; Muhammad Shah
was frivulous and fond of ease and luxury. Opinions of the emperor’s favourites
weighed in the appointments, promotions, and dismissals even in the provinces.
15.2 THE RISE OF REGIONAL POLITIES AND STATES
The states that arose in India during the phase of Mughal decline and the following
century (roughly 1700 to 1850) varied greatly in terms of resources, longevity, and
essential character. Some of them- such as Hyderabad in the south, was located in an
area that had harboured regional state in the immediate pre-Mughal period and thus
had an older local or regional tradition of state formation. Others were states that had
a more original character and derived from very specific processes that had taken
place in the course of the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In particular, many
of the post- Mughal states were based on ethnic or sectarian groupings- the Marathas,
the Jats, and the Sikhs. In due course, the enrichment of the regions emboldened local
land and power-holders to take up arms against external authority. However, mutual
rivalry and conflicts prevented these rebels from consolidating their interests into an
effective challenge to the empire. They relied on support from kinsfolk, peasants, and
smaller zamindars of their own castes. Each local group wanted to maximize its
share of the prosperity at the expense of the others. The necessity of emphasizing
imperial symbols was inherent in the kind of power politics that emerged. Each of the
contenders in the regions, in proportion to his strength, looked for and seized opportu-
nities to establish his dominance over the others in the neighbourhood. They all needed"

a kind of legitimacy, which was so conveniently available in the long-accepted author-
ity of the Mughal emperor. They had no fear in collectively accepting the symbolic
hegemony of the Mughal centre, which had come to co-exist with their ambitions.
The gradual weakening of the central authority set in motion new types of provincial
kingdoms. Nobles with ability and strength sought to build a regional base for them-
selves. The wazir Chin Qilich Khan himself, showed the path. Having failed to re-
form the administration, he relinquished his office in 1723 and in October 1724 marched
south to establish the state of Hyderabad in the Deccan. The Mughal court’s chief
concern at this stage was to ensure the flow of the necessary revenue from the
provinces and the maintenance of at least the semblance of imperial unity. Seizing
upon the disintegration of the empire, the Marathas now began their northward ex-
pansion and overran Malwa, Gujarat, and Bundelkhand. Then, in 1738–39, Nadir
Shah, who had established himself as the ruler of Iran, invaded India.

15.3 THE MARATHA POWER
There is no doubt that the single most important power that emerged in the long twilight of
the Mughal dynasty was the Marathas. The most important Maratha warrior clan was of
the Bhonsles, Sivaji Bhonsle, emerged as the most powerful figure in the southern politics.
The good fortune of Sivaji did not fall to his sons and successors, Sambhaji, and his younger
brother, Rajaran. For a time it appeared that Maratha power was on the decline. But a
recovery was effected in the early eighteenth century, in somewhat changed circum-
stances. A particularly important phase in this respect is the reign of Sahu, who succeeded
Rajaram in 1708. Sahu’s reign, lasted for four decades upto 1749. It was marked by the
ascendancy of a lineage of Chitpavan Brahman ministers, who virtually came to control
central authority in the Maratha state. The Bhonsles were reduced to figureheads. Hold-
ing the title of peshwa (chief minister), the first truly prominent figure of this line is Balaji
Visvanath, who had helped Sahu in his rise to power. Visvanath and his successor, Baji
Rao I (peshwa between 1720 and 1740), managed to bureaucratise the Maratha state to
a far greater extent than had been the case under the early Bhonsles. They systematized
the practice of tribute gathering from Mughal territories, under the heads of sardeshmukhi"

and chauth (the two terms corresponding to the proportion of tribute collected). They
seem to have consolidated methods of assessment and collection of land revenue and
other taxes, on the lines of the Mughals. Much of the revenue terminology used in the
documents of the peshwa and his subordinates derives from Persian. This suggests a
greater continuity between Mughal and Maratha revenue practices.
The Maratha Confederacy
By the close of Sahu’s reign, a few powerful Maratha Kingdoms were in complete
control of their territories. This period saw the development of sophisticated networks
of trade, banking, and finance in the territories under their control. The banking houses
based at Pune, had their branches in Gujarat, Ganges Valley, and the south. Attention
was also paid to the Maritime affairs. Bala ji Visvanath took some care to cultivate
the Angria clan, which controlled a fleet of vessels based in Kolaba and other centres
of the west coast. These ships posed a threat not only to the new English settlement

of Bombay, but to the Portuguese at Goa, Bassein, and Daman. On the other hand,
there also emerged a far larger domain of activity away from the original heartland of
the Marathas. Of these chiefs, the most important were the Gaikwads (Gaekwars),
the Sindhias, and the Holkars. Also, there were branches of the Bhonsle family that
relocated to Kolhapur and Nagpur, while the main line remained in the Deccan heart-
land, at Satara. Let us examine their areas of influence.
The Bhonsles of Nagpur
Unlike the Kolhapur Bhonsles and the descendants of Vyamkoji at Thanjavur, both of
whom claimed a status equal to that of the Satara raja, the line at Nagpur was clearly
subordinate to the Satara rulers. A crucial figure from this line is Raghuji Bhonsle (ruled
1727–55), who was responsible for the Maratha incursions on Bengal and Bihar in the
1740s and early 1750s. The relations of his successors, Janoji, Sabaji, and Mudhoji, with
the peshwas and the Satara line were varying, and it is in this sense that these domains
can be regarded as only loosely confederated, rather than tightly bound together. Other
subordinate rulers who emerged under the overarching umbrella provided by the Satara
ruler and his peshwa were equally somewhat opportunistic in their use of politics.
The Gaikwads of Baroda
The Gaikwads, gathered prominence in the 1720. Initially they were subordinate not
only to the Bhonsles but also to the powerful Dabhade family. However, it was only
after the death of Sahu, when the power of the peshwas was further enhanced, that
the position of the Gaikwads truly improved. By the early 1750s, their rights on large
portion of the revenues of Gujarat were recognized by the peshwa. The expulsion of the
Mughal governor of the Gujarat province from his capital of Ahmadabad in 1752 set the
seal on the process. The Gaikwads preferred, however, to establish their capital in
Baroda, causing realignment in the network of trade and consumption in the area. The
rule at Baroda of Damaji (d. 1768) was followed by a period of some turmoil. The
Gaikwads still remained partly dependent on Pune and the peshwa, especially to inter-
vene in moments of succession crisis. The eventual successor of Damaji, Fateh Singh
(ruled 1771– 89), did not remain allied to the peshwa for long in the late 1770s and early
1780s, he chose to negotiate a settlement with the English East India Company, which
eventually led to increased British interference in his affairs. By 1800, the British rather
than the peshwa were the final arbiters in determining succession among the Gaikwads,
who became subordinate rulers under them in the nineteenth century.
The Holkars of lndore
In the case of the Holkars the rise in status and wealth was particularly rapid and
marked. Initially they had very little political power. However by 1730s their chief
Malhar Rao Holkar consolidated his position. He was granted a large share of the
chauth collection in Malwa, eastern Gujarat, and Khandesh. Within a few years,
Malhar Rao consolidated his own principality at Indore, from which his successors
controlled important trade routes as well as the crucial trading centre of Burhanpur.
After him, control of the dynastic fortunes fell largely to his son’s widow, Ahalya Bai,
who ruled from 1765 to 1794 and brought Holkar power to great glory. Nevertheless,
their success could not equal that of the next great chieftain family, the Sindhias.
The Sindhias of Gwalior
The Sindhias carved a prominent place for themselves in North Indian politics in the
decades following the third battle of Panipat (1761). Again, like the Holkars, the Sindhias
were based largely in central India, first at Ujjain, and later (from the last quarter of"

the . 18th century) in Gwalior. During the long reign of Mahadaji Sindhia (1761–94)
family’s fortunes were truly consolidated.
Mahadaji, proved an effective and innovative military commander. He employed a
large number of European soldiers in his force. His power grew rapidly after 1770. During
this period he managed to make substantial inroads into North India that had been weak-
ened by Afghan attacks. He intervened with some effect in the Mughal court during the
reign of Shah Alam II. The Mughal king made him the “deputy regent” of his affairs in the
mid-1780s. His shadow fell not only across the provinces of Delhi and Agra but also on
Rajasthan and Gujarat, making him the most formidable Maratha leader of the era. The
officials of the East India Company were very cautious in dealing with him.
His relations with the acting peshwa, Nana Fadnavis at Pune were fraught with tension.
Eventually, the momentum generated by Mahadaji could not be maintained by his suc-
cessor Daulat Rao Sindhia (ruled 1794–1827), who was defeated by the British and
forced by treaty in 1803 to surrender his territories both to the north and to the west.
The careers of some of these potentates, especially Mahadaji Sindhia, illustrate the po-
tency of Mughal symbols even in the phase of Mughal decline. For instance, after recap-
turing Gwalior from the British, Mahadaji took care to have his control of the town sanc-
tioned by the Mughal emperor. Equally, he zealously guarded the privileges and titles
granted to him by Shah Alam, such as amir al-umara (“head of the amirs”) and na’ib
wakii-i mutlaq (“deputy regent”). In this he was not alone. Instances in the 18th century
of states that wholly threw off all pretense of allegiance to the Mughals are rare. Rather,
the Mughal system of honours and titles, as well as Mughal- derived administrative termi-
nology and fiscal practices, continued despite the decline of imperial power.

15.4 THE NAWABS OF BENGAL
Murshid Quli Khan who started his career as Diwan of Bengal under Aurangzeb became
virtually independent with the growing weakening of the central authority. However, he
regularly sent tribute to the Mughal emperor. Ali Vardi Khan deposed the family of Murshid
Quli Khan and made himself the Nawab in 1739. These Nawabs brought stability and
peace and promoted agriculture, trade and industry. Equal opportunities were given to
both Hindus and Muslims. But the Nawabs could not visualise the long term implications
of the presence of the European trading companies and neglected military preparedness.
In 1756–1757, the successor of Ali Vardi Khan, Siraj- ud - Daulah had to fight the English
East India Company over the trading rights. His defeat in the battle of Plassey in June
1757 paved the way for subjugation of Bengal as well as India.
15.5 THE NA WABS OF AW ADH
With the weakening central control the Mughal suba of Awadh also saw emerging
ambitions of a provincial governor- Saadat Khan Burhan ul Mulk. Saadat Khan disci-
plined the local zamindars and gave shape to a well paid, well armed and well trained
army. Before his death in 1739, Saadat Khan made the provincial head a hereditary
position. His successors Safdar Jung and Asaf ud Daulah not only played very decisive
role in the politics of northern India but also gave a long term administrative stability to
the nawabi of Awadh. Under the Nawabs firstly Faizabad and then Lucknow became
the cultural rival of Delhi in the spheres of arts, literature and crafts. Regional architec-
ture reflected itself in the form of Imambarah and other buildings. The evolution of
dance form Kathak was the outcome of cultural synthesis.
15.6 THE SIKHS OF PUNJAB
The Mughal force supressed the Sikhs under Banda Bahadur. But this did not put an
end to Sikh resistance to Mughal authority. In the 1720s and 1730s, Amritsar emerged
as a centre of Sikh activity, mainly because of its preeminence as a pilgrimage cen-
tre. Kapur Singh, the most important of the Sikh leaders of the time, operated from its
vicinity. He gradually set about consolidating a revenue-cum military system. Some
Sikh groups also started consolidating themselves as political force. These activities
discouraged the attempts by the Mughal governors of Lahore Suba to set up an
independent power base for themselves in the region. First Abdus Samad Khan and
then his son Zakariya Khan attempted to control sovereign power. After the latter’s
demise in 1745, the balance shifted still further in favour of the Sikh warrior- leaders,
such as Jassa Singh Ahluwalia. He later on founded the kingdom of Kapurthala. The
mushrooming of pockets under the authority of Sikh leaders was thus a feature of the
two decades preceding Ahmed Shah Abdali’s invasion of the Punjab. This process
was evident in the eastern Punjab and Bari Doab. Though the principal opposition
faced by Abdali in his campaigns of the 1750s and 1760s in the Punjab came from the
Sikhs, Marathas also played a role of significance on this occasion. Eventually, by the
mid- 1760s, Sikh authority over Lahore was established, and the Afghans were not
able to consolidate their early gains. Under Ahmad Shah’s successor, Timur Shah
(ruled 1772–93), some of the territories and towns that had been taken by the Sikhs
(such as Multan) were recovered, and the descendants of Ahmad Shah continued to
harbour ambitions in this direction until the end of the century. But by the 1770s, they
were dealing with a confederation of about 60 Sikh chieftains, some of these were to
emerge as princely states under the British- such as Nabha and Patiala."

HISTORY
 Understanding Eighteenth Century India
The Sikh chiefdoms continued many of the administrative practices initiated by the
Mughals. The main subordinates of the chiefs were given jagir assignments. The
Persianized culture of the Mughal bureaucracy continued to hold sway. It was one such
chief, Ranjit Singh, grandson of Charhat Singh Sukerchakia, who eventually welded
these principalities for a brief time into a larger entity. Ranjit Singh’s effective rule lasted
four decades, from 1799 to 1839. The power of the English East India Company was
growing in all parts of the country during this period. Within ten years of his death, the
British had annexed Punjab. His rise to power was based on superior military force,
partly serviced by European mercenaries and by the strategic location of the territories
that he had inherited from his father. Ranjit Singh’s kingdom represented the culmina-
tion of nearly a century of Sikh rebellions against Mughal rule. It was based on the
intelligent application of principles of statecraft. He used as his capital the great trading
city of Lahore, which he captured in 1799. Having gained control of the trade routes, he
imposed monopolies on the trade in salt, grain, and textiles from Kashmir to enhance his
revenues. Using these earnings, he built up an army of 40,000 cavalry and infantry. By
the year 1809 he was undisputed master of the most of Punjab.
15.7 JAIPUR AND OTHER RAJPUTANA STATES
Jaipur (earlier Amber) in eastern Rajasthan, was a Rajput principality controlled by
the Kachwaha clan. In the early eighteenth century, the ruler Jai Singh Sawai took steps
to increase his power manyfold. This was done by: (i) arranging to have his jagir assign-
ment in the vicinity of his home territories and (ii) by taking on rights on land revenue
through farming (for collection of land tax rights on a parcel of land that are rented by the
state to an individual), which was gradually made permanent. By the time of his death in
1743, Jai Singh (after whom Jaipur came to be named) had emerged as the single most
important ruler in the region. Most of the larger Rajput states were constantly involved in
petty quarrels and civil wars. Ajit Singh of Marwar was killed by his own son.
In the 1750s Suraj Mal the Jat ruler of Bharatpur, like Jai Singh- adopted a modified form
of Mughal revenue administration in his territories. However, by this time, the fortunes of
the Jaipur kingdom were seriously in question. Under threat from the Marathas, recourse
had to be taken to adopt short- term fiscal exactions. At the same time a series of crop
failures in the 1750s and 60s adversely affected fragile agriculture. The second half of the
eighteenth century was thus marked by an economic depression, accompanied by a de-
cline in the political power of Jaipur. During this period Jaipur became a vulnerable target
for the ambitions of the Marathas, and of Mahadaji Sindhia in particular.
The states discussed so far, with the exception of Maratha, were all landlocked. This
did not mean that trade was not an important element in their makeup, for the king-
dom of Ranjit Singh was crucially linked to trade. However, lack of access to the sea
greatly increased the vulnerability of a state, particularly in an era when the major
power was the English East India Company, itself initially a maritime enterprise.
15.8 POLITICS IN SOUTH INDIA
In the south, unlike the areas discussed so far, several states did make a determined
bid in this period to consolidate their power by the use of access to sea and ports.
Principal among these were Travancore in Kerala under Martanda Varma and Rama
Varma, and Mysore under Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan.
These states rose to prominence only in the latter half of the eighteenth century, or at
least after 1740. Before that, the southern Indian scene had been dominated by a
group of Muslim notables who had accompanied the Mughal expansion into the"

region in the 1680s and 1690s, or else had come in a second wave that followed immedi-
ately after 1700. Many of these notables set themselves up as tribute-paying chiefs under
Mughal authority. Some of them were relatively petty nawabs (deputies) of the Balaghat,
or northern Karnataka (such as Abdul Rasul Khan of Sira). A few of them were political
heavy weights like the Nizam-ul-Mulk himself and Sadullah Khan at Arcot. The Nizam-ul-
Mulk had consolidated his position in Hyderabad by the 1740s, whereas the Arcot princi-
pality had emerged some three decades earlier. Neither of these rulers, while establishing
dynastic succession, claimed full sovereignty. Thus they continued to cast themselves as
representatives of Mughal authority. Southern Indian politics in the 1720s emerged, there-
fore, as a game with many petty players and three formidable ones: the Marathas (both at
Thanjavur and elsewhere), the Nizam, and the Arcot (or Karnatak) Nawab.
In the second half of the eighteenth century, the power of all three of these centres
declined. The succession struggle at Arcot in the 1740s and early 1750s left its rulers
open to financial manipulation by private British merchants, to whom they were in-
creasingly in debt for war expenses. In the 1750s the power of Hyderabad also de-
clined (after the death of its founder, the Nizam-ul-Mulk). The control of the coastal
districts was soon lost, leaving the kingdom landlocked and relatively sparsely popu-
lated. In this context, the only option for states was to build an elaborate and well-
organized war machine while keeping external supply lines open. The control of trade
was also seen as crucial in the statecraft of the period.
The State of Travancore
These principles were put into practice in the southern Kerala state of Venad
(Travancore) by Martanda Varma (ruled 1729–58). The king initiated a few mea-
sures to strengthen his authority. These were (i) he built a substantial standing army
of about 50,000 (ii) reduced the power of the Nayar aristocracy on which rulers of the
area had earlier been dependent militarily, and (iii) fortified the northern limits of his
kingdom at the so-called “Travancore line.” It was also the policy of this ruler to
extend patronage to the Syrian Christians, a large trading community within his do-
mains, as a means of limiting European involvement in trade. The key commodity was
pepper, but other goods also came to be defined as royal monopoly items, requiring a
license for trade. These policies were continued in large measure by Martanda’s
successor, Rama Varma (ruled 1758–98), who was able to defend his kingdom suc-
cessfully against a dangerous new rival power- Mysore.
The Rise of Mysore
Under rulers of the Vadiyar dynasty, such as Kanthirava Narasaraja and Chikka
Deva Raja Mysore emerged as an important state. However, Mysore was a land-
locked kingdom and dependent therefore on trade and military supplies brought through
the ports of the Indian east coast. As these ports came increasingly under European
control, Mysore’s vulnerability increased. From the 1760s, steps were taken to change
this situation. A cavalry commander of migrant origin, Haidar Ali, assumed effective
power in the kingdom in 1761, reducing the Vadiyars to figureheads and displacing the
powerful Kalale family of ministers. First Haidar and then, after 1782, his son, Tipu
Sultan, made attempts to consolidate Mysore and make it a kingdom with access to
not one but both coasts of peninsular India. Against the Kodavas, the inhabitants of
the upland kingdom of Kodagu (Coorg), they were relatively successful. Coastal
Karnataka and northern Kerala came under their sway, enabling Tipu to open diplo-
matic and commercial relations on his own account with the Middle East. Tipu’s
ambitions apparently greatly exceeded those of his father, and he strove actively to"

escape the all- pervasive shadow of Mughal suzerainty, as discussed above. How-
ever, the problem with the Mysore of Haidar and Tipu was their inability to build an
internal consensus. Their dependence on migrants and mercenaries, for both military
and fiscal expertise, was considerable, and they were always resisted by local chiefs,
the so called Poligars. More crucial was the fact that by the 1770s Mysore faced a
formidable military adversary in the form of the English East India Company, which
did not allow it any breathing room. It was the English who denied Mysore access to
the relatively rich agricultural lands and ports of the Coromandel coastal plain in east-
ern India. Tipu was also finally killed in 1799 by the English forces.

15.9 THE ECONOMY IN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY INDIA
The eighteenth century can hardly be said to exhibit any substantial economic conti-
nuity between its earlier and later parts. It was a period of considerable political
turmoil in India, one in which states were formed and dissolved in quick succession.
That there was a great deal of fluidity in the system. It is of course true that raids by
military forces would have caused dislocation. The destruction of irrigation tanks, the
forcible expropriation of cattle wealth, and even the forced march of masses of people
were not unknown in the wars of the 1770s and thereafter. All these must have had a
harmful effect on economic stability and curtailed the impulse toward growth.
When viewed from Delhi, the 18th century is certainly a gloomy period. The attacks
of Nadir Shah, then of Ahmad Shah Abdali, and finally the attacks by the Rohillas
(who controlled Delhi in 1761–71) put the city in a state of regular destruction. This
perspective can hardly have been shared by the inhabitants of other centres in India,
whether Trivandrum, Pune, Patna, or Jaipur. There was a process of economic reori-
entation that accompanied the political decentralization of the era, and it is on account
of this that the experience of Delhi and Agra cannot be generalized. However, the
conditions of different regions were not uniform. In some, the first half of the eigh-
teenth century witnessed continued expansion- Bengal, Jaipur, and Hyderabad, for
example. While some others were late bloomers, as in the case of Travancore, Mysore,
or the Punjab. No single chronology of economic prosperity and decline is likely there-
fore to fit all the regions of India in the epoch. Despite some key weaknesses and
contradictions the economy of the eighteenth century performed well in the spheres
of agriculture, inland trade and urbanization. There were some areas which saw ag-
ricultural decline- often because of inter state warfare as in the Punjab and parts of
north India. Lack of new agricultural methods and techniques was overcome with the
experience and management of land and labour. Data of Taqsim papers used and
compared vis a vis Ain-i-Akbari proves that it was not the lack of cultivable land but"

Notes
 Understanding Eighteenth Century India
lack of labour and peace which resulted into declining agricultural production and
fluctuating agricultural prices as well. At the same time the price rise benefited the
peasants but unequally according to vertically divided sections of peasantry. States
exacted tribute from systems of agricultural commodity production that tied villages
to expansive networks of commercial mobility and exchange.
It is noteworthy that, except for a major subsistence crisis in south India between
1702 and 1704, the first seven decades of eighteenth century in India were remark-
ably free of famine. The great Bengal famine of 1770, in which an estimated one- third of the
population perished, occurred soon after the colonial conquest. This was followed by another
disastrous famine in north India in 1783. Overall a favourable land- labour ratio had enabled
highly mobile peasant and tribal labour to negotiate reasonable terms with controllers of land.
But the excessive revenue demands made the peasants’ desertion a regular phenomenon
particularly in north India. While some village notables managed to transform revenue farms
into hereditary estates, others felt the squeeze from powerful regional states as Tipu’s Mysore.
Population, production, prices and wages tended, generally speaking, to be on a gentle up-
ward incline during the eighteenth century. Fragmented polities did not hamper the develop-
ment of a thriving inland trade in grain, cloth and cattle. Corporate merchant institutions
transcended political boundaries in overseeing the transportation of goods and the provision
of credit and insurance services. Pre- colonial era artisnal labour, especially weavers, had
ample scope for successfully resisting extravagant demands by intermediate social groups
and the state. Even an intrusive state like late- eighteenth century Mysore appeared to attack
intermediaries rather than labour. Evidence from Bengal and Madras suggests that urban
labour was worse off in relation to the state and the market in the early colonial than in the
immediate precolonial period. While inland trade did well, the Indian shippers and merchants
involved in export trade declined in the face of European advances. The great Gujarati port
city of Surat lost its importance around 1720. There was a resurgence of demand for Indian
goods in both West and South East Asia in the late eighteenth century in addition to European
demand, but by now British merchants and shippers had achieved dominance at the expense
of Indians and took the bulk of the profits.
As the old commercial centres of Surat, Masulipatnam and Dhaka degenerated, colonial
port- cities like Bombay, Madras and Calcutta took their pride of place. But the decline of the
Mughal capitals of Delhi and Agra was offset by the rise of regional capitals, including
Lucknow, Hyderabad, the various Maratha cities, and Seringapatam. The level of urbaniza-
tion was clearly higher in 1800 than a century before. What had changed in the urban centres
was the relative balance of power between rulers and merchants. In some instances, com-
mercial and financial magnets were arrogating to themselves the powers of the state.
It would also appear for a variety of reasons, that the mid- eighteenth century marks
a significant change in economic sphere. For example, once the English East India
Company got hold on the revenues of Bengal subah the flow of money was ad-
versely affected. While earlier Bengal received gold and silver in exchange for its
exports, this pattern no longer held. In later part of eighteenth century the peasants
were forced to cultivate certain cash crops like indigo and opium. This had adverse
impact on food crop production. But another reason why the latter half of the eigh-
teenth century differs from the period before about 1750 is the changing character of
war. In the post-1750 period, warfare became more disruptive of civil life and eco-
nomic production than before, and at the same time the new technologies in use made it
a far more expensive proposition. The use of firearms on a large scale, the employment
of mercenaries, the maintenance of standing armies, all of these had harmful affects."

HISTORY
 Understanding Eighteenth Century India
15.10 THE SOCIAL CONTEXT
The social life in eighteenth century India was continuation of the past legacy. De-
spite some universal features of socio- cultural unity through out India over the centu-
ries, there was no uniformity in the social patterns. The society was divided into multi
layered identities on the basis of religion, region, tribe, language, class and caste.
Hindus were divided on the basis of hundreds of castes. The caste was decided by
birth, fixing the permanent place of the people in social hierarchy. Inter- caste mar-
riages and inter caste- dining was forbidden. Traditionally, caste was the basis of the
profession but by the eighteenth century to some extent social and professional mobil-
ity was being followed. For example Brahmans started adopting various progenies
and pursuing trading activities. The caste continued to be a major divisive force.
Muslims were also influenced by the considerations of race, caste, tribe and status. The
Shias and Sunnis had major religious differences while the Irani, Afghani, Turani and
Hindustani Muslims had lot of differences to stand apart from each other. People con-
verted to Islam carried their caste into the religion. The basic social unit was the family
based on patriarchal patterns except Kerela where matrilineal system was prevalent.
Women’s were expected to live as the role models of ideal daughters, wives and moth-
ers. Women of the upper classes, in north India, had to follow purdah. Child marriages
was prevalent and marriage was a social obligation between the two families. Among
the upper classes polygamy and dowry was prevalent but the greatest evil of eighteenth
century India were the custom of sati and the condition of widows among the Hindus.
The education system could not change according to the requirements of the time.
The curriculum was confined to literature, languages, law, religion, philosophy and
logic and excluded the study of physical and natural sciences, technology and geogra-
phy. There was lack of progressive ideas as theoretical framework dominated. El-
ementary education was widespread. Mediums of higher education were Sanskrit
and Persian only. Moreover, this education excluded females and low caste people.
15.11 THE CULTURAL MILIEU
It is generally maintained that the eighteenth century witnessed a general decline in
material life, the cultural life of the period also has often been denigrated. However,
there appears to be little justification for such a portrayal of the 18 th century. Even
Delhi, whose economic condition unequivocally declined, had a number of major po-
ets, philosophers, and thinkers in this epoch, from Shah Waliullah to Mir Taqi Mir.
Further, as regional courts grew in importance, they tended to take on the function of
the principal patrons of high culture, whether in music, the visual arts, or literature. It
is thus also in relatively dispersed centres, ranging from Awadh to Bikaner and Lahore
to Thanjavur, that one finds the courtly traditions of culture persisting. Thanjavur
under the Marathas is a particularly fine example of cultural efflorescence, in which
literary production of a high quality in Tamil, Telugu, Sanskrit, and Marathi continued,
with some of the Maratha rulers themselves playing a significant direct role. Similarly,
it is in the eighteenth century Thanjavur that the main compositions of what is today
known as the Karnatak tradition of Indian classical music came to be written, by such
men as Tyagaraja, Muttuswami Diksitar, and Syama Sastri. Finally, the period brought
the development of a distinct style of painting in Thanjavur, fusing elements imported
from the north with older local traditions of textile painting.
This vitality was not restricted purely to elite culture. To begin with, many of the
theatre and musical traditions, as well as formal literary genres of the period, picked"

up and ‘reincorporated folk influences. At the same time, the interaction of popular
Hinduism and Islam gave a particular flavour to cultural activities associated with
pilgrimages and festivals. More than in earlier centuries, the tradition of long-distance
pilgrimages to major centres from Varanasi to Rameswaram increased and scan be
seen to fit in with a general trend of increasing mobility. It was common for post-
Mughal states to employ mercenary soldiers and imported scribes and clerks. In eigh-
teenth century Hyderabad, for example, Kayasthas from the north were employed in
large numbers in the bureaucracy. ln Mysore, Maharashtrian Brahmans were given
fiscal offices as early as the 1720s. It is apparent that the mobility of musicians, men
of letters, and artists was widely prevalent. When a major new political centre emerged,
it rapidly attracted talent, as evidenced in Ranjit Singh’s Lahore. Here, Persian
literature of high quality was produced, but not at the cost of literary output in Punjabi.
At the same time, new developments were visible in the fields of architecture and
painting. Farther to the north, the principality of Kangra fostered an important new
school of painting, devoted largely to Vaishnava themes. The cultural assimilation was
outcome of mutual influence and respect. Among the major religions the Marathas
supported the shrine of Shaikh Muinuddin Chisti in Ajmer and the Raja of Tanjore
financed the shrine of Shaikh Shahul Hamid of Nagaur. Tipu Sultan of Mysore
supported Shringeri temple and Muslims joyfully participated in the Hindu festivals
just as the Hindus were part of Muharram processions. Indeed, a surprisingly large
proportion of what is understood today to be part of India’s ‘traditional” culture is
attributable to this period and also to the preceding century.
15.12 DEBATE AND PROBLEMS IN UNDERSTANDING THE
HISTORY OF EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
The debate on the nature of eighteenth century has engaged historians of Mughal
India as well those interested in colonial studies. Early Mughal studies view the over
all changes in the shadow of Mughal political collapse and project the period as “Dark
Ages”, thus Mughal political crisis is seen to be accompanied by economic and social
breakdown as well. However, later studies scrutinize eighteenth century economy
and society in regional perspectives preceding the beginning of the colonial rule that
characterized the second half of the eighteenth century. Thus the two positions argue
around “continuity versus change” paradigm. Generally, Indian historians perceive the
colonial conquest which began from the mid eighteenth century as a point of departure
for Indian history. So the basic issues pertaining to eighteenth century are two- whether
the fall of Mughal Empire initiated the fall of socio- economic structure as well and
secondly, whether the arrival of colonialism was a fundamental break or not?
Was the eighteenth century a Dark Age or was it a period of economic boom? Did it
mark a sharp break or was it a period of continuity and change? How British power
in India expanded during the eighteenth century? These and other questions concern-
ing the nature of politics, society, economy, religion and culture made the study of
history of eighteenth century highly debatable. Historians have traditionally viewed
India’s eighteenth century as a dark era of warfare, political chaos, and economic
decline sandwiched between stable and prosperous Mughal and British hegemonies.
This view has been vigorously challenged by the most recent generation of Indian
historians, who have emphasized the continuities between the earlier Mughal and
later British states and the constellation of small successor states that emerged with
the ebbing of Mughal power. The political turmoil which affected the whole century,
forces one to ask whether the fall of the Mughal empire led to a break of the central"

political authority triggering the phase of anarchy, firstly leading to the rise of regional
kingdoms then paving the way for dominance of British colonialism. Here it is important
to understand whether just the decline of the Mughal state should be seen as a failure of
Indian society as well as the vacuum created by the fall of the central authority filled up
by the regional powers namely, Nawabs of Awadh and Bengal and Nizam of Hyderabad
in the first half of the century. Moreover, whether the emergence of British East India

regional kingdoms such as Hyderabad, Awadh and Bengal. The contribution of the
regional rulers as well as their internal conflicts are also highlighted.
Emergence of the Maratha confederacy and finally the breakup of Marathas into five
Maratha Kingdoms of Bhonsle, Gaikwad, Holkar, Sindhia and Satara was is another
important phase. The power of the Peshwas and some of the important administra-

1. Political turmoil and raids of military forces were two main reasons for economic
instability.
2. The great Gujarati port city of Surat lost its importance though there was still a
great demand of Indian goods. The British merchant and shippers controlled the
export trade by replacing Indian.
3. Colonial cities like Bombay, Madras, Calcutta replaced earlier commercial cen-

4. In many ways the eighteenth century social life was a continuation of past legacy
without much change. The society was divided on the multilayered identities on
the basis of religion, tribe, cast, language, class etc."

ESTABLISHMENT OF BRITISH RULE
IN INDIA TILL 1857
16
Notes
Before the beginning of the formal rule of the Britishers in India, there was a back-
ground of Indo-European economic relationship. The British East India Company
sometimes referred to as “John Company”, was a Joint- Stock Company established
in 1600, as The Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East Indies.
During this time, other trading companies, established by the Portuguese, Dutch,
French, and Danish were similarly expanding in the region. The British Company
gained footing in India in 1612 after Mughal emperor Jahangir granted the rights to
establish a factory (a trading post) in Surat to Sir Thomas Roe, a representative
diplomat of Queen Elizabeth Ist  of England. The formal British rule in India is under-
stood to have commenced in 1757, after the Battle of Plassey, when the Nawab of
Bengal surrendered his dominions to the British East India Company. Henceforth the
British Company transformed from a commercial trading venture to a political entity
which virtually ruled India. Now it acquired auxiliary governmental and military func-
tions, until its dissolution in 1858 when, consequent to the Government of India
Act 1858, the British government assumed the task of directly administering India.

Even after securing the control over the trade routes during sixteenth-seventeenth

Europe than were European goods in India. Merchants might profit handsomely through
the sale of Indian goods, which were of both better quality and lesser price than
similar European products. The result was both a drain of bullion from Europe to
India, as well as stiff competition for European producers who were unable to match
either the price or quality of Indian goods.
In fact the British East India Company, in the first 50 years of its existence, had no
interest in the development of colonies, preferring to engage in trade only, following
the pattern set by the Portuguese. This pattern was changed by 1650 when the power
of the old guard British royalist merchants was broken, and a new class of merchants
wrested control of the Company. They followed the pattern set by the colonial mer-
chants in American colonies and the West Indies, and sought to establish a network of
colonies linking England, Africa and India in a complicated network of exchange
relationships.
The Mughal Empire declined in the first half of the eighteenth century. The political
vacuum was filled by the rise of regional states like Bengal, Hyderabad, Awadh,
Punjab and Maratha Kingdoms. But these regional powers could not provide lasting
political stability resulting into a lustful chance for the British East India Company to
establish a territorial empire in India. Now a set of institutions and regulations were
required to rule India through colonial mechanism. They adopted three methods to
expand the British Empire. They were: 1. Wars and conquests, 2. Subsidiary
Alliance System, and 3. annexation of territories through the adaptation of
doctrine of lapse. Initial method was outright military conquest or direct annexation
of territories; it was these areas that were properly called British India. Latter on to
consolidate its position diplomatic efforts through treaties and agreements with indig-
enous rulers were also made.

1. Discuss the methods the  British used to establish their rule in India.
2. Name the Indian regional states in the first half of the eighteenth century.
16.2 ANGLO-FRENCH STRUGGLE IN SOUTH INDIA
By the beginning of the eighteenth century only two European trading companies
of the British and the French were left in India competing for the Indian
resources. The Anglo- French rivalry, taking the form of three Carnatic Wars
constituted landmarks in the history of British conquest of south India in the
eighteenth century. In order to establish their supremacy, it was necessary for
the English East India Company to eliminate the French from this region. As a
result of Seven Years’ War (1756–1763) in Europe, the French and English settle-
ments in India also became involved in open hostilities. In the third Carnatic war,
the British East India Company defeated the French forces at the battle of
Wandiwash ending almost a century of conflict over supremacy in India. This"

battle gave the British trading company a far superior position in India compared
to the other Europeans. The French were defeated by Sir Eyre Coote at
Wandiwash in January, 1760, and Pondicherry capitulated a year later. The work
of Dupleix and Bussy in the South was thus destroyed in 1760–1761; the French
possessions in India were, however, restored by the treaty of Paris (1763). This
conflict was resolved in the English East India Company’s favour because of its
strong navy in India, its progressively increasing military strength and good lead-
ership, the support they received from the Government in England, and the larger
resources at its command in Bengal. A part of the fallout of the events in the
Carnatic cycle of wars that the weakness of the Indian regional powers (in par-
ticular their inability to make naval interventions and the ineffectiveness of large
armies of some of their powers against smaller European forces) became mani-
fest and this had grave implications in the political history of the rest of the
eighteenth century.

16.3 BRITISH OCCUPATION OF BENGAL: PLASSEY TO
BUXAR  (1757–1765)
The first major conflict of the British against an Indian power was in Bengal. The
history of Bengal from 1757 to 1765 is the history of gradual transfer of the power
from the nawabs to the British. During this short period of eight years three nawabs,
Siraj-ud- Daula, Mir Jafar and Mir Qasim ruled over Bengal but they failed to uphold
the sovereignty of the nawab and ultimately the reign of control passed into the hands
of the British .The British, unable to compete with the Asian merchants in business,
resorted to force, taking control of Bengal in 1757 under the pretext of the “Plassey
revolt”. The result was that the British achieved victory in Bengal, for their use of
force led to the decline of the very trade they so longed to control. By the time Siraj-
ud- Daula succeeded Ali Vardi Khan as nawab of Bengal in 1756 trade privileges and
their misuse by the Company and its officers had already become an issue of conflict.
There was a privilege which had been granted to the Company for its export and
import trade by the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar. According to this Imperial farman,
the Company had to pay Rs. 3000 a year and in return could carry on trade duty- free
in Bengal. The Company’s servants extended this privilege to their own coastal trade,
inter- Asian trade and finally the inland trade. This was an obvious usurpation. Cer-
tain other factors like the fortification around Calcutta without the permission of the"

nawab and repeated defiance of the nawab’s authority along with sheltering the
offenders of the nawab were the acts on the part of the English Company which
provoked the nawab. The Company officials also suspected that nawab was going
to have an alliance with the French in Bengal. Siraj-ud-Daula’s attack on Calcutta
precipitated an open conflict. The British retaliation started with hatching a con-
spiracy against the nawab in alliance with his officers like Rai Durlabh, Ami Chand,
Mir Jafar and Jagat Seth. So English victory in the battle of Plassey (23 June, 1757)
was pre-decided. It was not the superiority of the military power but the conspiracy
that helped the English in wining the battle. Mir Jafar, The commander-in-chief of
the Nawab was awarded the Nawabship by Clive for his support to the English.
Mir Jafar responded by paying a sum of Rs.One Crore and Seventy Seven lakhs
(17,700,000) to the Company and large sums to the Company officers as bribe. But
Mir Jafar could not support the ever increasing demands of the English who were
also suspicious about his collaboration with the Dutch Trading Company. Mir Jafar,
who was made nawab  after the battle of Plassey, was deposed in 1760. Mir Qasim
was placed on the throne by the British in the hope that he would be able to meet
their financial demands. The new Nawab assigned to them the district of Burdawan,
Midnapore and Chittagong for the expenses of the British army which was to
help him. This alliance was of great help to the British in their campaign against
the French in 1760–1761; the money paid by Mir Qasim helped the Calcutta
Council to finance their war in South. The Nawab succeeded in establishing a
better system of administration. But he came into conflict with the British in
Bengal on the question of a privilege i.e. duty free private trade of the Com-
pany. Mir Qasim’s proposed plan about equal trade duties for British and In-
dian traders was turned down by the British council at Calcutta. Mir Qasim, in
the circumstances, remitted all duties on Indians and the British alike for two
years. This measure deprived the British private traders of the privileged posi-
tion they had created for themselves, they could not compete with Indian trad-
ers on equal terms. The Nawab’s attempts to reorganize the army and shifting
of capital from Murshidabad to Monghyr were also taken as unforgivable of-
fences by the Company.
In June 1763 under Major Adams British army defeated Mir Qasim the Nawab of
Bengal. Mir Qasim fled to Patna and took help from Emperor Shah Alam II and Shuja-
ud-Daula (Who was Nawab of Awadh and also the Wazir of the Mughal empire).
Matters came to a head when the chief of the Company’s factory at Patna, tried to
seize the city. This precipitated war. Mir Qasim, an excellent civil administrator, was no
military leader. His army was defeated. When he was forced to withdraw to Awadh,
the Nawab Wazir and emperor Shah Alam II decided to come to the defence of the
eastern subas of the empire. The confederates advanced to Patna, and a battle was
fought at Buxar on October 22, 1764. With a decisive victory at Buxar, the British army
overran Awadh. The Nawab Wazir fled to the Rohilla country, but Shah Alam II came
to terms with the British. Lord Clive, then British Governor in Calcutta, also concluded
treaty of Allahabad with the Shuja-ud-Daula Nawab Wazir of Awadh, who was to pay
fifty lakhs of rupees for the expenses of the war and was given back his dominions. He
entered into defensive alliance with the Company. Awadh became for the British a
buffer state. Shah Alam II was now a fugitive- Delhi had now fallen into the hands of
the Rohilla chief Najib-ud-daulah. The British gave emperor Shah Alam II possession
of Kara and Allahabad, while he granted them the Diwani of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa
in return for a regular annual payment of twenty- six lakhs of rupees."

16.4 THE DUAL SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION OF BENGAL
The early mechanism of the establishment of Company rule in Bengal followed
the administrative system under the Mughals. The Mughal provincial administra-
tion had two main heads - nizamat and diwani . Broadly speaking, nizamat  meant
administration of law and order and criminal justice; while diwani  was the rev-
enue administration and civil justice. The provincial Subadar  was in charge of
nizamat  (he was also called nazim) and the diwan was in charge of revenue
administration. After the treaty of Allahabad the English East India Company
was made the Diwan of Bengal but Lord Clive choose not to take over the ad-
ministration of Bengal directly; this responsibility was left to the Nawab’s Naib
Diwan and Naib Nazim  Muhammad Raza Khan. As naib nazim he was to repre-
sent the nawab and as naib diwan he was to represent the Company. Thus the
Nawab had to handle the entire responsibility for the civil and criminal justice
administration. However, he had to function through Muhammad Raza Khan who
was placed under the superintendence, direction and control of the British Com-
pany. As the Diwan, the Company directly collected its revenue, while through
the right to nominate the Deputy Nazim , it controlled the nizamat  or the Police
or Judicial powers. This arrangement is known as ‘ Dual or Double Govern-
ment’. Under this system British had power and resources without responsibility
while the Nawab had the responsibility of the administration without power to
discharge it. Thus the Nawab had to take all responsibility for bad governance.
The revenue remained the sole earning of the Company in lieu of a meager an-
nual payment to the Mughal emporer.

16.5 IDEOLOGY OF EXPANSION: TOOLS AND METHODS
Shifting its role from a trading corporation, the English East India Company gradu-
ally became supreme political power in India. There were other regional kingdoms
which were conquered by the British. Haidar Ali and his son Tipu Sultan  the leg-
endary rulers of Mysore (in Carnatic, modern day Indian state of Karnataka ), gave
a tough time to the British forces in the second half of the eighteenth century.
Haidar Ali was in command of the army in Mysore from 1749; he became the ruler
of the state in 1761. Until his defeat by Sir Eyre Coote in 1781 Haidar Ali continued
his struggle against the Company. Mysore finally fell to the Company forces in
1799, with the slaying of Tipu Sultan in 1799. With the gradual weakening of the
Maratha Empire in the aftermath of the three Anglo-Maratha wars fought during
1772-1818, the British also secured the Maratha territories. It was during these
campaigns, both against Mysore and the Marathas, that under the command of
Arthur Wellesley, the British had secured the entire region of Southern India (with
the exception of small enclaves of French and local rulers), Western India and
Eastern India.
 The second method was the use of subsidiary agreements ( sanad) between the
British and the local rulers. This development created what came to be called the
Native States, or Princely States. The Subsidiary Alliances system was also intro-
duced by Lord Wellesley in and after 1798. The British, under the subsidiary alliance
system, agreed to protect the Indian rulers against external threats and internal disor-
der but, in return, the Indian rulers who accepted the Subsidiary Alliance system
were to agree to the stationing of British contingent for whose maintenance they
would pay a subsidy to the British. The ruler under the system of alliance could
neither enter into alliance with any other power nor fight a war without prior permis-
sion from the British. A British resident was stationed at these ruling states that had
the authority to interfere in state politics. This system was suited best to the advan-
tage of the British as, without even spending a single penny the British were able to
maintain large forces. Moreover this system enabled the English to weed out the
foreign influence from the Indian courts. The Nizam of Hydrabad was first to enter
into a subsidiary alliance with the English in 1798. He was forced to replace the
French officers from his court and put English officers in their place. He also granted
the territories of Bellari and Cudappah to British for the maintenance of the army.
The subsidiary alliances created the Princely States (or Native States) of the Maha-
rajas and the  Nawabs, prominent among which were: Cochin (1791), Jaipur (1794),
Travancore (1795), Hyderabad (1798) and  Mysore (1799). The annexed regions
included the North Western Provinces (comprising Rohilkhand, Gorakhpur, and the
Doab) (1801), Delhi (1803), and Sindh (1843). Punjab, Northwest Frontier Province,
and Kashmir, were annexed after the Anglo-Sikh Wars in 1849. Kashmir was sold
under the Treaty of Amritsar (1850) to the Dogra Dynasty of Jammu, and thereby
became a princely state. In 1854 Berar was annexed, and the state of Oudh two
years later. The Main purpose of the subsidiary alliance system was to expand the
British Empire in India by bringing new territories under its control and to decrease
the French influence so that The British could become the paramount power in India.
Punjab remained the last Indian state to be conquered by the British in 1849. It was
under the rule of Maharaja Ranjit Singh who had united the various Sikh misls into
one state. He had established a modern administrative system. His army was the"

Company maintained friendly relations with Ranjit Singh .But just within one decade
of his death in 1839, two Anglo-Sikh wars were fought and in 1849 Punjab also be-

custom of adoption among the Indian kings to secure an heir in  the absence of a
natural successor i.e. son. But as per the doctrine of lapse any Indian state created by
or under the direct influence (paramount) of the British East India Company , as a
vassal state under the British Subsidiary System, would automatically “lapse” or an-
nexed by the British if the ruler was either incompetent or died without a natural male
heir. Thus not only the long-established right of the Indian sovereigns without an heir
to choose successor was taken over, but the British also took over the authority of

deciding the competence of  the Indian rulers. With the introduction of this policy of
lapse, the Company could establish absolute, imperial administrative control over many
regions spread over the subcontinent. The Company took over the princely states of
Satara, Jaitpur , Sambalpur, Nagpur and Jhansi using this Doctrine. Often the annex-
ation, such as that of Awadh [Oudh] in 1856, was justified on the grounds that the
native prince was of evil disposition, indifferent to the welfare of his subjects.

in India?

3. Explain the Doctrine of Lapse?
16.6 GROWTH OF COLONIAL  ADMINISTRATIVE  APPARATUS
The need for constitutional change arose after the East India Company became the
political power in 1757 .The  British Government was no longer willing to allow the
Company’s affairs to continue unsupervised .Pressure from merchants and manu-
facturers to end the monopoly of the Company mounted .Public opinion was critical
of corruption in the Government in Bengal. Free enterprise was a major demand. The
British Parliament enacted a series of laws among which the Regulating Act of 1773
stood first, to curb the Company traders’ unrestrained commercial activities and to
bring about some order in territories under the Company control. Limiting the Com-
pany charter to periods of twenty years, subject to review upon renewal, this  act
gave the British government supervisory rights over the Bengal, Bombay, and Ma-
dras presidencies. The Regulating Act also created a unified administration for India,
uniting the three presidencies under the authority of the Bengal’s governor, who was
elevated to the new position of governor-general. Warren Hastings was the first
incumbent governor-general (1773–1785). The Pitt’s India Act of 1784 sometimes
described as the “half-loaf system”, as it sought to mediate between Parliament and
the company directors, enhanced Parliament’s control by establishing the Board of
Control, whose members were selected from the British cabinet. As governor-gen-
eral from 1786 to 1793, Lord Cornwallis, professionalized, bureaucratized, and Euro-
peanized the company’s administration. He also outlawed private trade by company
employees, separated the commercial and administrative functions, and enhanced the
salaries of company’s servants.
As revenue collection became the company’s most essential administrative func-
tion, Lord Cornwallis granted legal ownership of land to the zamindars in Bengal.
In return, zamindars had to pay the government fixed revenue by a certain
particular date. This arrangement was to last for ever; hence the title “perma-
nent settlement” was given. This system was also known as the zamindari sys-"

 ESTABLISHMENT OF BRITISH RULE IN INDIA TILL 1857
tem. The immediate consequence was that as now zamindar became the owner
of the land, the peasant was reduced to the status of the tenant on his own land.
Moreover now land became a negotiable property and the state was excluded
from agricultural expansion and development, which came under the purview of
the zamindars. In Madras and Bombay, however, the ryotwari  (peasant) settle-
ment system was set in motion, in which peasant cultivators had to pay annual
taxes directly to the government.
The Charter Act of 1813 ended the monopoly of the Company over trade with India.
The Company’s control over revenue, administration and appointments remained un-
touched. The Charter Act of 1833 abolished the Company’s monopoly of the China
trade. The Act also deprived the presidencies of the power to make laws, concentrat-
ing legislative power with the Governor-General and his council.
With such expansion of the British territories and the increasing administrative responsi-
bilities, a bureaucracy was also required to control British possessions. In 1785, Lord
Cornwallis created a professional cadre of Company servants who had generous sala-
ries, had no private trading or production interests in India, enjoyed the prospect of regular
promotion and were entitled to pensions. All high-level posts were reserved for the Brit-
ish, and Indians were excluded. Cornwallis appointed British judges, and established Brit-
ish officials as revenue collectors and magistrates in each district of Bengal. From 1806
the Company trained its young recruits in Haileybury College near London. Appointments
were still organized on a system of patronage. In 1829 the system was strengthened by
establishing districts throughout British India small enough to be effectively controlled by
an individual British official who henceforth exercised a completely autocratic power,
acting as revenue collector, judge and chief of police. After 1833 the Company selected
amongst its nominated candidates by competitive examination. After 1853, selection was
entirely on merit and the examination was thrown open to any British candidate. The
Indian civil service (i) was very highly paid; (ii) it enjoyed political power which no bu-
reaucrat could have had in England.

emergence of British judicial system in India. The Mayor’s Court was estab-
lished in 1727 for civil litigation in Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras. In 1772 an
elaborate judicial system, known as adalat , established civil and criminal juris-
dictions. Both Hindu pandits and Muslim qazis (Sharia court judges) were re-
cruited to aid the presiding judges in interpreting their customary laws, but in
general, British common and statutory laws became applicable. The two main
theoretical principles underlying the entire British judicial system in India were
the notions of the Rule of Law and Equality before law ; thus as per theory no
one was above the law (certain rules which defined the rights, privileges and
obligations of the people) and all the citizens irrespective of their caste, class and
other status, were now equal before law. The principle of habeas corpus pro-
vided that no person could be arrested or kept in prison without a written order
from the local executive or the judicial authority. Even the Government servant,
if the acts done in their official capacity could be sued in the court of Law. The
natural upshot of the Rule of Law was the Equality before the Law, which sub-
sequently followed the Rule of Law. The Equality before the Law appeared as a
novel feature in the caste-ridden Indian society.
Under the Regulating Act of 1773 the King-in-Council created a Supreme Court in the
Presidency town of Calcutta. Under the charter, the Supreme Court also  had the
authority to exercise all types of jurisdiction in the region of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa,
with the only caveat that in situations where the disputed amount was in excess of Rs.
4,000, their judgment could be appealed to the Privy Council at London. The Supreme
Courts in Madras and Bombay were finally established in 1801 and 1823, respectively.
Lord Cornwallis separated the executive and judicial duties at district level. For
the civil cases Sadar Diwani Adalat was the highest appealing body followed
by the four Provincial Courts of Civil Appeal at Calcutta, Dacca, Murshidabad
and Patna. Then at local levels District Courts, Registrars’ Courts and a number
of Subordinate Courts were making the hierarchy. A large number of magis-
trates were active to deal with criminal cases, above them were four Courts of
Circuit at Calcutta, Dacca, Murshidabad and Patna which were governed by
Sadar Nizamat Adalat  at Calcutta. In 1831 William Bentinck abolished the four
Provincial civil and criminal courts and redistributed their work to Commission-
ers and District Collectors.

Indian princely states and formed laws and policies of their own. Slowly but rapidly
the entire Indian sub continent came under the British rule. However its policies
were disliked by Indians and together they revolted against the company in 1857.
This led to the downfall of the company and the administration of India went di-
rectly under the Queen. By the Government of India Act of 1858 the direct rule of
the British Crown was finally established in place of the Company’s rule.
WHAT YOU HA VE LEARNT
You have learnt about the establishment of rule or dominion of the British East India
Company on the Indian subcontinent. You have seen how British rule commenced in
1757, after the Battle of Plassey, when the Nawab of Bengal surrendered his domin-
ions to the Company, in 1765, when the Company was granted the diwani, or the
right to collect revenue, in Bengal and Bihar, or in 1772, when the Company estab-
lished a capital in Calcutta, appointed its first Governor-General, Warren Hastings,
and became directly involved in governance. This process continued in the other
parts of India as well. The establishment and expansion of British Power used the
mechanism of the Subsidiary Alliance system, and the expansion policy of Dalhousie

GLOSSARY:
1. East India Company: The Company was a Joint- Stock Company established
in 1600, as The Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East Indies.
Initially involved in trading with India, it remained ruling power in India till 1858.
2. Dual or Double Government: This system was introduced in Bengal after
the battle of Buxar. As the Diwan of Bengal the Company directly collected its
revenue, while the nizamat or the Police and Judicial powers remained with the
Nawab.
3. Subsidiary Alliance system: The Subsidiary Alliance System was used by
lord Wellesley to bring the Indian states within the boundary of the British politi-
cal power. Under this doctrine, Indian rulers under British protection suspended
their native armies, instead maintaining British troops within their states. They
surrendered control of their foreign affairs to the British. In return, the East India
Company would protect them from the attacks of their rivals.
4. Doctrine of Lapse: It was an annexation policy by the British East India Com-
pany, introduced by lord Dalhousie Governor -general of India. Under the doc-
trine princely territory under the direct rule of the East India Company would
automatically be annexed if the ruler was either incompetent or died without a
direct heir.
5. Charter Acts: The Charter Acts were passed by the British Parliament to
govern the activities of the East India Company, endowed it with enormous Com-
mercial privileges and granted them the powers to rule India up to 1858. The
Charter Acts issued enabled the East India Company, commercial privileges in
several series, for twenty years each. The first Charter Act was granted in 1793,
granting the company provision of 20 years. Later the Charter Act was renewed
in the year 1813, 1833 and 1853 respectively.

ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF BRITISH
COLONIALISM
17
Notes
Britain’s relationship with her Indian colony was one of political subordination, but
economic exploitation formed the core of this relationship. This process of coloniza-
tion was geared clearly to benefit the mother country, even at the cost of the colony.
In this chapter we will discuss the aspect of economic exploitation within the process
of colonization.
OBJECTIVES
After studying the lesson, you will be able to:
 delineate the three phases of British colonization in India
 comprehend the changes brought by colonial revenue settlements in the Indian
countryside
 analyse the mixed impact of colonial capitalist innovations within the colony;
 explain the ‘drain of wealth’ theory propounded by early nationalists and
 understand the distinct nature of  colonial ‘modernisation’ in the colony and that
it did not necessarily imply ‘progress’
PHASES OF BRITISH COLONIALISM
Colonial exploitation was carried on broadly through three phases. The first phase
(1757-1813) of ‘mercantilism’ was one of direct plunder in which surplus Indian
revenues were used to buy Indian finished goods to be exported to England. In the
second phase (1813-1858) of free trade India was converted into a source of raw
material and a market for British manufactured goods. The third phase (1858 on-
wards) was one of finance imperialism in which British capital controlled banks,
foreign trading firms and managing agencies in India. This phased exploitation was
carried out through a range of economic policies, primarily in the industrial and agri-
cultural sectors of the colonial economy.
17.1 THE FIRST PHASE OF BRITISH COLONIALISM
This ‘First Phase’ is generally dated from 1757, when the British East India Company
acquired the rights to collect revenue from its territories in the eastern and southern
parts of the subcontinent, to 1813, when the Company’s monopoly over trade with
India came to an end.

ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF BRITISH COLONIALISM
The British had come to India in the seventeenth century, purely as a trading company,
backed by an exclusive royal charter to trade with India, from their queen, Elizabeth I.
They set up their first ‘factory’ on the banks of the Hughli River in Bengal. The Com-
pany had managed to acquire permits or a ‘dastak’ from the Mughal emperor that
exempted it from having to pay duties on its trade. This led to a great deal of corruption
among the employees of the Company, as the ‘farman’ was widely misused by them for
their private trade. It also meant heavy losses in revenue for the Bengal governors
(later nawabs) in way of customs duties. This became a contentious issue and one of
the chief factors, which led to the Battle of Plassey, fought in 1757.
The primary function of the British East India Company in this period was to buy
spices, cotton and silk from India and sell them at huge profits to the large market
these goods enjoyed in Britain. This meant that large quantities of bullion would flow
out of Britain into India to pay for these commodities. Despite efforts, it seemed
difficult to find British goods that could be sold in India in exchange, to stem this
outflow of bullion. Besides the expenditure on buying commodities, the Company also
spent very large amounts on the wars that it had to fight with other European powers,
all in search of the same goods to trade in. These included the Portuguese, the Dutch
and the French. Thus the acquisition of ‘diwani’ (right to collect revenue) in Bengal,
after the Battle of Buxar, which followed the Battle of Plassey, opened the way for
the Company to raise money for its expenditure in India.
LAND REVENUE POLICIES
After the diwani of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa was granted to the East India Company
in 1765, the maximization of revenue from the colony became the primary objective
of the British administration. Agricultural taxation was the main source of income for
the company, which had to pay dividends to its investors in Britain. Therefore, the
British administration tried out various land revenue experiments to this aim. These
experiments also partly determined the relationship that the colonial state would share
with the people it governed.
In 1772, the Governor of Bengal, Warren Hastings, introduced a system of revenue
farming in the province of Bengal. In this system European District Collectors would
‘farm’ out the right to collect revenue to the highest bidder. This system was a total
failure and ruined the cultivators because of the arbitrarily high revenue demands.
To undo this disaster, Cornwallis introduced the system of Permanent Settlement
in 1793. Under this system, ‘zamindars’, who earlier only had the right to collect rev-
enue, were established as the proprietors or owners of land. The state’s demand for
land revenue was permanently fixed But if the zamindars were unable to pay the full tax
on time, their lands would be taken away and auctioned by the state. Through this
system, the state tried to create an enterprising class of landowners, who would try to
improve crop production in their fields to earn profits. Besides, it would be simpler for
the state to deal with a limited number of zamindars than with every peasant, and a
powerful section of society would become loyal to the British administration.
But this system led to greater impoverishment of the tenant-cultivator because of the
burden of high revenue assessment. It also caused great difficulty for zamindars,
many of whom were unable to pay the revenue on time and lost their lands. A large
number of traditional zamindar houses collapsed. The system also encouraged
subinfeudation i.e. many layers of intermediaries between the zamindar and
cultivator, adding to the woes of the peasantry.

HISTORY
ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF BRITISH COLONIALISM
To keep out intermediaries from revenue collection, so that the state could acquire a
larger share of the income from land, the Ryotwari System was started by Alexander
Read in 1792, for the Madras Presidency. Later it was introduced in the Bombay
Presidency as well. Under this system, revenue was initially collected from each
village separately, but later each cultivator or ‘ryot’ was assessed individually. Thus,
peasants not zamindars were established as property owners. Although this system
increased the revenue collected by the state, the assessments were faulty and the
peasants overburdened by the taxes. The landed intermediaries continued to flourish.
In the north and northwest of India the Mahalwari Settlement was followed after
1822 where the state made settlements with either the village community or, in some
cases, the traditional ‘taluqdar’. Each such fiscal unit was called a ‘mahal’. Under
this system, some recognition was given to collective proprietary rights.
As a result of the revenue policies of the British, agriculture stagnated and peasants
almost became tenants at will. They also increased the number of landed intermediar-
ies, and strongly entrenched the figure of the moneylender in the countryside. Landlords
and zamindars became an important class and collaborators of British colonial rule.
The acquisition of diwani rights meant that the Company could now tap the wealth of
local rulers, zamindars and merchants in the rich province of Bengal and use them to
buy the goods that would be shipped to Britain for sale. Large quantities of wealth,
including illegal incomes of company officials, made its way to Britain from Bengal.
Company officials amassed huge fortunes before they returned home, and they were
referred to as ‘nabobs’ in Britain, on account of their flashy lifestyles. A lot of this
money was used to fuel the Industrial Revolution in Britain. The greed for incomes
from land revenue also led the Company to pursue an aggressive policy of territorial
expansion in India.

crown took over the direct control and administration of all British territory in India.

ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF BRITISH COLONIALISM
As the Company’s profits grew, the support they enjoyed from the British govern-
ment became precarious. Earlier many members of the parliament had ‘East Indian’
interests, who used the Company’s resources to maintain their patronage within the
government. But as unprecedented levels of industrialization were achieved in Brit-
ain, there was a gradual change in the constitution of the parliament. Adam Smith’s
book, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, heralded a
new school of economic thought, which critiqued the idea of companies enjoying
exclusive monopolies and lobbied for a government policy of ‘free trade’ or ‘laissez
faire’. In a bid to acquire greater control over the Company’s earnings, the parliament
started attacking individual Company officials with charges of ‘misconduct’. The
‘Free Traders’, dominant in the parliament with the turn into the 19th century, de-
manded free access to India, which led to the passing of the Charter Act of 1813, thus
ending the monopoly enjoyed by the Company in India, while subordinating its territo-
rial possessions to the overall sovereignty of the British crown.
‘Free Trade’ changed the nature of the Indian colony completely, through a dual
strategy. Firstly it threw open Indian markets for the entry of cheap, mass-produced,
machine-made British goods, which enjoyed little or almost no tariff restrictions. The
passage of expensive, hand-crafted Indian textiles to Britain, which had been very
popular there, was however obstructed by prohibitive tariff rates. And secondly Brit-
ish-Indian territory was developed as a source of food stuff and raw material for
Britain, which fuelled rapid growth in its manufacturing sector, crucial to the emer-
gence of a powerful capitalist economy. These changes reversed the favourable
balance of trade that India had enjoyed earlier. This phase laid the foundations of a
classic colonial economy within India through the complex processes of commercial-
ization of agriculture and deindustrialization, which are discussed below.
COMMERCIALIZATION OF AGRICULTURE
It is often believed that the colonial administration encouraged the commercialization of
agriculture that improved the position of peasants in many areas of the Indian colony.
From the 1860s onwards, the nature of agricultural production was determined by the
demands of the overseas markets for Indian primary products. The items exported in the
first half of the nineteenth century included cash crops like indigo, opium, cotton and silk.
Gradually raw jute, food grains, oil seeds and tea replaced indigo and opium. Raw cotton
remained the most in demand item. This expansion in cash crop production was accompa-
nied by the building of railways, after 1850, to improve trade networks.
But commercialization seems to have been a forced artificial process that led to very
limited growth in the agricultural sector. It led to differentiation within the agricultural
sector, but did not create the figure of the ‘capitalist landowner’ as in Britain. The
lack of any simultaneous large scale industrial development meant that accumulated
agrarian capital had no viable channels of investment, for it to be converted into
industrial capital. Initiatives to expand the productive capacity and organization of
agriculture was also a risky proposition, as the sector catered to a distant foreign
market with wildly fluctuating prices, while the colonial state provided no protection
to agriculturists. Commercialization thus, increased the level of sub-infeudation in the
countryside and money was channelised into trade and usury.
The larger part of the profits generated by the export trade went to British business
houses, which controlled shipping and insurance industries, besides commission agents,
traders and bankers. Those who benefited in the colony were big farmers, some

Indian traders and moneylenders. Commercialization further intensified the feudal
structure of landlord-moneylender exploitation in rural areas.
The so called process of commercialization, which was supposed to lead to capitalist
agriculture, was often carried out through very exploitative and almost unfree forms of
labour. Tea was grown in plantations in Assam, owned by whites, and they used inden-
tured labour, which was almost like slavery. White planters had to force farmers to
grow indigo because it yielded low profits and upset the harvesting cycle. This involved
inhuman levels of coercion, which eventually led to the indigo-rebellion in 1859-60.
Commercialization did lead to limited phases of success in the cotton producing areas of
western India in 1860s and in jute production in eastern India, but they were because of
increases in demand rather than capitalist innovation in production and organization.
Farmers were forced to grow cash crops also because they had to pay the high
revenue, rents and debts in cash. The shift away from food crops like jowar, bajra and
pulses to cash crops often created disaster in famine years. A decline in world de-
mand for Indian cotton led to heavy indebtedness, famine and agrarian riots in the
Deccan cotton belt in the 1870s. The jute industry collapsed in the 1930s, which was
followed by a devastating famine in 1943 in Bengal. Although, causes of these fam-
ines have been widely debated by historians, it is undeniable that the aggregate pro-
duction of food crops remained far behind population growth, and millions of people
died of starvation and epidemics.
Among the limited steps that the colonial government took towards improving agri-
cultural productivity included the construction of some irrigation canals in northern,
north-eastern and south-western parts of India. ‘Permanently Settled’ eastern India got
left out this government initiative, because there was no scope of increasing the revenue
any further. Thus revenue maximization and limited famine-relief in extreme situations
were the factors that motivated this public investment. It did lead to great prosperity and
commercial agriculture in limited enclaves, especially in the canal colonies of Punjab, but

it was confined to a small number of already well-of farmers who could pay the high
water rates. It also encouraged the cultivation of cash crops like sugar, cotton and wheat,
while reducing the production of millets and pulses. In some cases, like the United Prov-
inces, it did not suit local conditions and caused swamps and excessive salinity.
In 1853, Lord Dalhousie took the decision to construct railways in India. Very often the
railways have been seen as a marker of the modernization that took place under British
rule. But the construction of the railways in India only further strengthened the colonial
nature of India’s economic development. The railway network made it easier to pen-
etrate the interior markets and sources of raw material in the colony and linked them to
port cities, instead of linking internal markets to each other. The railway network was
thus primarily geared to serve the interest of foreign trade. Railway lines built in frontier
regions would facilitate army movement and some “famine lines” were built in scarcity
areas. Moreover, the whole project was built with British capital, and investors in Brit-
ain were guaranteed 5% interest, which was paid out of Indian revenue. Most of the
high level expertise and railway equipment like machinery, railway lines and even coal
to an extent, was imported from Britain. This ensured that the ‘multiplier’ effects of
constructing the railways also remained absent in India.
Amongst other factors, the penetration of the interiors of the country, made possible
by the railways, had another grave fall out – the ruin of the Indian handicrafts indus-
try, which had enjoyed patronage both from local ruling elites and markets overseas.
With the expanding control of the British, traditional native courts disappeared. The
British also enforced an unequal tariff system, whereby the entry of Indian commodi-
ties in British markets was restricted by high custom duties. In turn, the Industrial
Revolution in Europe enabled the mass production of cheap machine-made goods,
which flooded Indian markets. Unable to compete with this, Indian commodities lost
both their overseas and domestic markets. This destructive process led to
deindustrialisation that increased pressure on land.

British capital was invested in the colony. This capital was organized through a closed
network of British banks, export-import firms and managing agencies.
Although the process of colonization has been divided into stages, one should keep in
mind that this periodisation is in some ways arbitrary. The third phase was merely a
consolidation of the trends that were already witnessed clearly in the second phase. It
may be more useful to study these phases as heavily overlapping, where new and
more subtle forms of exploitation existed alongside older, cruder forms. However, the
new development that marked out the third phase was an intensification of the rivalry
between developed and industrialized countries, for colonies in Asia, Africa and Latin
America. In the 19th century, countries like France, Belgium, Germany, the United
States, and even Japan witnessed rapid industrialization. In the face of competition in
the world market, Britian’s lead in this regard dwindled. In search for newer markets
and sources of raw material, these countries stepped up their drive for colonies and
strengthened their control over existing ones. Industrial development also led to capi-
tal accumulation, which was concentrated in a small number of banks and corpora-
tions. This capital was invested in the colonies to sustain the rapid inflow of raw
materials to fuel further expansion of industrial production.
High tariff restrictions in other developing capitalist countries led to a contraction of
markets for British manufactured goods. And the need for heavy imports of agricul
tural products into Britain, was making her position vulnerable in her trade with other
countries. India proved crucial in solving the problem of Britain’s deficits. Britain’s
control over India ensured that there would always be a captive market for Lancashire
textiles. Moreover, India’s export surplus in raw material with countries other than
Britain, counter-balanced her deficits elsewhere.
While on the one hand indigenous handicrafts faced impoverishment, on the other
hand, there were few attempts at developing modern industries in the colony. Al-
though the colonial government spoke about ‘free trade’, indigenous enterprise faced
many obstructions perpetuated by the state’s discriminatory policies. British capital
was initially invested in railways, jute industry, tea plantations and mining. The Indian
money market was dominated by European banking houses. While British entrepre-
neurs had easy access to capital made available by this banking network, Indian
traders had to depend on family or caste organizations for their capital needs. British
banking houses and British trading interests were well organized through Chambers
of Commerce and Managing Agencies and could also influence the colonial state, to
carefully deny Indian entrepreneurs access to capital. Before the First World War,
British Managing agencies controlled 75% of industrial capital, and most of the profits
from this limited industrialization were also sent back to Britain.
But, inspite of heavy odds, Indian entrepreneurs found opportunities to expand and
grow, whenever Britain underwent periods of economic hardship. It was during the
First World War that some Marwari businessmen from Calcutta, like G.D.Birla and
Swarupchand Hukumchand invested in the jute industry. Gradually their control started
expanding into other areas like coal mines, sugar mills and paper industry, and they
could even buy up some European companies. The greatest success of Indian capital
was seen in the cotton industry in western India, which took advantage of high de-
mands during the war years (1914-18) to consolidate its successes, and eventually
was in competition with Lancashire. Certain traditional trading communities like Gujarati
Banias, Parsis, Bohras and Bhatias became important in this sector. The Tata Iron

and Steel Company under government patronage provided leadership to the fledgling
iron and steel company of India.
After the first world war, links with the foreign market was re-established, but again in
the Depression years (1929–1933), the domestic market became relatively free to be
exploited by indigenous industry, as foreign trade declined. The colonial government
also provided some protection to the sugar and cotton industries, in the face of falling
prices in the agricultural sector. Low prices forced capital from land into the manufac-
turing sector. Indians also ventured into the field of insurance and banking. Again, during
the Second World War (1939–45), as foreign economic influence declined, Indian en-
trepreneurs managed to make huge profits. Strengthened by its limited success, the
Indian capitalist class strengthened their links with the nationalist movement. They soon
started demanding the establishment of heavy industries under state ownership and
started organizing themselves to resist the entry of foreign capital.
But, to place these markers of success in perspective, on an overall level, these devel-
opments remained confined to the domestic market and indigenous capital still had a
long battle ahead, against the structural weaknesses of a colonial economy. The poten-
tial for growth remained depressed given the massive poverty of the Indian people.
Early Indian nationalists like Dadabhai Naoroji, M.G. Ranade and R.C.Dutt had ex-
pected Britain to undertake capitalist industrialization in India, but were deeply disillu-
sioned with the results of colonial industrial policies. Consequently, they formulated a
strong economic critique of colonialism in the late nineteenth century. Dadabhai Naoroji
put forward the drain of wealth theory. Poverty in India, according to them, was the
result of a steady drain of Indian wealth into Britain-a result of British colonial policy.
This drain occurred through the interest that India paid for foreign debts of the East
India Company, military expenditure, guaranteed returns on foreign investment in
railways and other infrastructure, importing all stationery from England, ‘home charges’
paid for the Secretary of State in Britain and salaries, pensions and training costs of
military and civilian staff employed by the British state to rule India. Even if this drain
was a small fraction of the value of India’s total exported, if invested within the
country it could have helped generate a surplus to build a capitalist economy.
The ultimate question that has been asked of colonial economic policies in India is
whether there had been any development at all. The answer to this question is not
simple. We may start with looking at eighteenth-century Mughal India, before the
British had entrenched themselves as an invincible territorial power. The view that
eighteenth century Mughal India was undergoing a deep economic crisis and decline
has been pervasive among historians. It has been seen as the decisive broader con-
text within which we may locate the decline of the Mughal empire. But some later
historians have refuted this view, and have instead drawn attention to the rise of new
rebellious groups into power, to account for the fall of the empire. They have argued
that the Mughal period was in fact a period of over all well-being and economic
growth rather than stagnation or crisis. Within the political structure, there was suffi-
cient space and autonomy in the hands of local landed elites and urban guilds to
generate and accumulate surplus. Moradabad-Bareilly, Awadh. Banaras and Bengal
were some such ‘surplus areas’. Forests were being cleared to expand cultivation.
Consequent rises in agricultural yield and the establishment of a cash nexus made
surplus accumulation possible in the hands of erstwhile landlords and zamindars, who
challenged Mughal paramountcy to emerge as the new regional power elite.

INTEXT QUESTIONS 17.3
1. Which world event provided Indian entrepreneurs the first opportunity to expand
and grow?
2. Who propounded the ‘drain of wealth’ theory?
3. Have later historians seen the 18th century as a period of economic backwardness?
Thus, the picture we get of India is one of a buoyant economic climate with a
reasonable potential for growth. How do we then explain the backwardness and
poverty that we encounter , at the end of the subsequent 200 years of British colo-
nialism? Some writers have argued that the British did try to partially ‘modernize’
India, but it failed because of the strong hold of traditional structures. But we have
noted above that these half-hearted attempts at ‘modernisation’ were motivated
primarily to benefit the ‘mother country’. Backwardness in the ‘peripheral’ colo-
nies needs to be seen as the necessary flip side of the Industrial Revolution in the
‘core’, centred on the West. The same processes that led to industrialization in
Britain, generated and sustained backwardness in her Indian colony, because the
British economy was linked parasitically to the Indian economy , in an integrated
world economic system of ‘free trade’.
India in 1947 was not at a pre-industrial stage, and so her post-independence eco-
nomic growth patterns may not be compared with processes of industrialization in the
West. In 1947, India had already been a part of capitalist development in the west for
200 years, but in capacity of a colony. So, in 1947, independent India embarked into a
process of modernization from a ‘colonial’ mode rather than a ‘traditional’ mode,
which was structurally backward and underdeveloped.
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNT
Phased economic exploitation of the colony was the core motive for the British to
establish their rule in the Indian subcontinent. The nature of this exploitation changed
over the course of their reign, owing to changes within Britain, and these in turn had
specific economic, social and political consequences for the colony. Most economic
initiatives undertaken by the colonial state was couched in the language of development
and ‘modernisation’, but they had a differential impact on the colony, often leading to
backwardness rather than growth. And finally most of these initiatives helped exploit
the resources of the country to enable industrialization in Europe.

SOCIAL CHANGES IN MODERN
INDIA
18
Notes
The Indian subcontinent witnessed significant social changes during the 18-19th cen-
turies. The onset of British rule, increasing urge for social and religious reform, rise of
a middle class, rapid growth of newspapers in both English and Indian languages,
changes in physical infrastructure and semi-political unification of the country were
partly responsible for these changes. The end of the Mughal rule was followed by the
strengthening of many regional kingdoms during the 18th century. The gradual expan-
sion of British rule in this vacuum signified an entirely unfamiliar system of gover-
nance with long term repercussions.
OBJECTIVES
After studying this lesson, you will be able to:
 trace the broad outlines of cultural policies of British rulers in India;
 examine the nature of the conflict between the Orientalists and the Anglicists;
 assess the impact of British rule on educated classes in India;
 explore the evils in the social and religious life;
 explain the background of the rise of a modern Indian intelligentsia;
 the reform movements and the issues raised by them;
 identify the stages of the growth of western education in India and
 identify the stages of the growth of press in India.
18.1 BRITISH CULTURAL POLICIES IN INDIA
The beginning of British rule in India witnessed many imperial ideologies in operation.
Back home in England, there were divergent ideologies at work regarding best pos-
sible ways of governing the Empire. Policies were often driven by the popularity of
specific ideologies in Europe in general and England in particular. They also depended
upon the whims and fancies of higher British authorities in India. After the battles at
Plassey (1757) and Buxar (1764), British rulers faced many difficulties in governing
the regions they had won. It will be very interesting to see that different ideologies
took centre stage at different times."

HISTORY
 SOCIAL CHANGES IN MODERN INDIA
Orientalists
The first generation of British administrators in India like Warren Hastings, William
Jones and Jonathan Duncan popularised the view that India had a glorious past which
had subsequently degenerated. These scholars and administrators were called
Orientalists. They were keen to learn and propagate Indian languages and tradition.
This, they thought, would ensure a better understanding of India which would eventu-
ally strengthen their rule over this country. To stretch this argument further, we can
say that the Orientalists depicted India’s past in a way that was in consonance with
the needs of the colonial administration. Important institutions that came to be identi-
fied with their efforts were the Calcutta Madrassa founded by Warren Hastings
(1781), the Asiatic Society of Bengal  founded by William Jones (1784) and the
Sanskrit College at Benaras  founded by Jonathan Duncan (1794).
William Jones learnt Indian classical languages and found important linguistic con-
nection between Sanskrit and classical western languages like Greek and Latin. For
around fifty years, the Asiatic Society was an important centre of learning and a rare
institution to undertake translations of notable Sanskrit texts. An important journal
published by it was the Asiatick Researches. Warren Hastings held the view that
Hindus possessed laws which continued unchanged for centuries. Therefore, the Brit-
ish should master these laws and the Sanskrit language in which these texts were
written if they wished to establish their governance in the country.  To provide a
precise idea of the customs and manners of Hindus, N. B. Halhed published A Code
of Gentoo Laws in 1776.
There was a strong urge to make local British administrators familiar with Indian
culture and tradition. Fort William College founded by Wellesley in 1801 to train the
young British recruits to the civil service in India was meant to serve primarily this
purpose. This college became an important centre for producing knowledge on and
about India. It had many departments devoted exclusively to research on Indian lan-
guages and literature.
Influence of Ideas on administrative and economic policies
Influence of ideas was clearly visible in the administrative and economic policies.
Lord Cornwallis, who became Governor General in 1786, was influenced by the 18th
century Whig political philosophy. In the Whig philosophy, the main organs of the
government, i.e. executive, legislative and judiciary should be separate. This would
provide check and balance on each other’s activity so that no organ exercises arbi-
trary powers. Philip Francis and Edmund Burke were the two most eminent political
thinkers of the 18th century England. Burke insisted that the prosperity of the natives
must be secured before any attempt was made to reap profit from them. Philip Francis,
his friend and a member of the Supreme Council in Calcutta in the 1770s, drew up a
comprehensive plan for administering property in Bengal. This plan subsequently in-
fluenced Cornwallis’ policy of Permanent Settlement for Bengal, Bihar and Orissa in
1793. Cornwallis succeeded in laying the foundation of a strong Whig policy in the
governance of Bengal. You will read more about the policy of Permanent Settlement
in the chapter dealing with economic history of British period.
England was the first country to experience Industrial Revolution which led to a mas-
sive increase in the output of finished products. British industrial capitalists now
argued for a free play in the British colonies. They put pressures on the British
government to curtail the company’s monopoly in the Indian market. Free market"

theorists influenced the ideological positions of many policy makers in India as well.
Finally the Charter Act of 1813 abolished Company’s monopoly of trade with India.
Simultaneously, the Liberals and the Utilitarians gained strong positions within the
policy making apparatus of India.

3. Who established the Fort William College?
4. Which was the first country to experience Industrial Revolution?
5. Which Act abolished the monopoly of the East India Company over the India
Trade?
18.2 SOCIO-RELIGIOUS REFORMS
A distinct feature of the 19th century India was the urge for social and religious reforms
which cut across castes and communities. India had a long tradition of religious reforms
and social dissent. During the ancient period, an urge for reform can be seen in
Upanishadic texts, Buddhism, Jainism, Vajrayan, Tantricism etc. During the medieval
age, the popularity of the Bhakti and the Sufi saints is well known. Attempts to explore
India’s past by the first generation of British rulers helped to sharpen educated classes’
consciousness of their own existence. Early reformers were groping to find suitable
answers. But the agenda for the modernization was not set by the western influence
because the logic for reform was sought to be located within India’s past.
BENGAL RENAISSANCE
Reform movements which took deep roots within Bengal have often been termed as
Bengal Renaissance. Bankim Chandra Chatterji and Bipin Chandra Pal referred to
developments in the 19th century Bengal as a period of Renaissance. It may not be
proper to compare European Renaissance with developments in Bengal as the con-
text was entirely different and the patterns not too similar. However, the features
which were referred to while talking of a Bengal Renaissance may be clubbed under
three major categories, i.e. historical rediscovery, linguistic and literary modernization
and socio-religious reforms.
BRAHMO SAMAJ

HISTORY
 SOCIAL CHANGES IN MODERN INDIA
Atmiya Sabha, founded in 1814, discussed important social and political questions of the
time. In 1828, its enlarged edition was called the Brahmo Sabha which was renamed
Brahmo Samaj later on. Soon he started touching upon many burning social issues of
the time including the widely-prevalent practice of becoming sati. He rallied support to
the efforts of William Bentinck (Governor General) for abolition of this custom and
wrote extensively for the cause. In 1829, the custom of sati was formally abolished. He
also condemned polygamy and many other forms of subjugation of women. Roy was
also an advocate of modern education. He opened an English school as well as a
Vedanta college (1825). He was a firm believer in the concept of one God. He was
opposed to idolatry and found Upanishads as the basis of true Hinduism. He wished to
purify Hinduism by removing all kinds of evils that had crept into it over centuries. He
was not opposed to English education and spread of western knowledge.
After Roy’s death in 1833, the Brahmo Samaj started getting disorganized. It was
given a definite shape and popularized beyond the city of Calcutta under the leader-
ship of Debendranath Tagore who joined in 1842. A year later, he wrote Brahmo
Covenant. This Covenant was a statement of the creed of the Samaj and made a list
of the duties and obligations of its members.
Keshab Chandra Sen (1838–84) who joined the Samaj in 1858 was a very eloquent
and persuasive leader. He took the activities of the Samaj beyond Bengal and into UP,
Punjab, Madras and Bombay. He radicalized the Samaj by attacking caste system,
underlining women’s rights, promoting widow remarriage and raising the issue of
caste status of Brahmo preachers which was earlier reserved for Brahmans. He laid
stress on universalism in religion. His radicalism brought him into opposition with

Debendranath. In 1866, the Samaj was formally divided into Adi Brahmo Samaj (headed
by Debendranath) and the Brahmo Samaj of India (headed by Keshab Chandra).
ISHWARCHANDRA VIDYASAGAR
Another Bengali reformer who actively raised the issues related to women was
Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar. He was an active proponent of education of girl child
as he believed that lack of education was the real cause underlying all their problems.
With the help of an Englishman named Bethun, he set up many schools devoted
especially to girl child. He forcefully attacked child marriage and polygamy. He was
a strong advocate of widow remarriage. It was due to his active mobilization of
support that the Widows’ Remarriage Act was passed in 1856 legalizing all widow
remarriages. He arranged many such remarriages. He set a personal example when
his son Narayan also married a widow.
Fig 18.2 Ishwarchandra
Vidhyasagar
Ramakrishna Mission
During the late 19th century, another notable reform movement in Bengal, which soon
spread to other parts of the country, was the Ramakrishna Mission. The movement
began under an ascetic and priest Gadadhar Chatterjee or Swami Ramakrishna
Paramhansa (1836–86) who achieved inner peace around 1871–2. He preached
universality of all religions and favoured preserving beliefs and rituals of Hinduism.
Among his important disciples was Narendra Nath or Swami Vivekananda who
accepted Ramakrishna as his guru in 1885. He spread the message of spiritual Hindu-
ism in America and Europe during his tour of 1893–97. He established Ramakrishna
Mission in 1897 and set up a Math at Belur. He died at a young age of forty in 1902.
Vivekananda was opposed to degeneration in religion, manifold divisions, caste rigidi-
ties, practice of untouchability, superstitions etc. He pointed out that the present
condition of Hindus was due to their ignorance which was helped by their being a
subject race. He attempted to establish Hindu spiritual supremacy vis-à-vis the selfish
civilization of the West. However, he believed that India had to learn work ethics,
forms of organization and technological advances from the West.
REFORM MOVEMENTS IN WESTERN INDIA
Many important reform movements arose during the 19th century western India. Re-
formers like KT Telang, VN Mandalik and RG Bhandarkar glorified India’s past.
There were some who led a direct attack on social evils like caste system and en-
couraged widow remarriage, e.g. Karsondas Mulji and Dadoba Pandurang. They
formed Manav Dharma Sabha in 1844 and Paramhansa Mandali in 1849. The Mandali
carried its activities secretly. Its members took a pledge that they would abandon all"

 SOCIAL CHANGES IN MODERN INDIA
caste distinctions. The Mandali declined after 1860 as its membership and activities lost
secrecy. Keshab Chandra Sen’s twin visits to Bombay in 1864 and 1867 had a deep
impact on social reform in this part. A direct consequence of his visits was the founding of
the Prarthana Samaj in 1867 by Atmaram Pandurang. Mahadev Govind Ranade, who ran
the Deccan Education Society, was the real force working behind this organization. Sev-
eral members of the Prarthana Samaj had earlier been active in the Paramhansa Mandali.
This Samaj denounced idolatry, priestly domination, caste rigidities and preferred mono-
theism. Apart from Hindu sects, it also drew upon Christianity and Buddhism. It sought
truth in all religions. Drawing inspiration from the Maratha Bhakti saints of the medieval
period, Ranade sought to establish the concept of one compassionate God.
Arya Samaj
The most profound reform movement in the late 19 th century India was the Arya
Samaj. It started in the western India and the Punjab, and gradually spread to a large
part of the Hindi heartland. It was founded by Dayanand Saraswati (1824-83). In
1875, he wrote Satyarth Prakash (or the light of truth) and in the same year founded
the Bombay Arya Samaj. The Lahore Arya Samaj was founded in 1877. Subse-
quently, Lahore became the epicentre of the Arya movement. Dayanand opposed a
ritual-ridden Hindu religion and called for basing it on the preaching of the Vedas.
Only Vedas, along with their correct analytical tools, were true. He attacked puranas,
polytheism, idolatry and domination of the priestly class. He adopted Hindi for reach-
ing out to the masses. He also opposed child marriage. He was fiercely opposed to
multiplicity of castes which he thought was primarily responsible for encouraging
conversion of lower castes into Christianity and Islam.
After Dayanand’s death in 1883, the Samaj lay scattered. Most important attempt to
unite the Samaj and its activities was the founding of the Dayanand Anglo Vedic
Trust and Management Society in Lahore in 1886. In the same year, this society
opened a school with Lala Hansraj as its principal. However, some leaders of the
Samaj were opposed to Anglo Vedic education. They were Munshi Ram ( Swami
Shraddhanand), Gurudatt, Lekh Ram and others. They argued that the Arya Samaj’s
educational initiative must focus on Sanskrit, Aryan ideology and Vedic scriptures and
should have little space for English learning. This militant wing thought that Dayanand’s
words were sacrosanct and his message in Satyarth Prakash could not be ques-
tioned. While the moderate wing led by Lala Hansraj and Lajpat Rai pointed out that
Dayanand was a reformer and not a rishi or sadhu. Conflicts also arose over the
control of the DA V Management Society. These differences finally led to a formal
division of the Arya Samaj in 1893 when Munshiram broke away along with his
supporters to initiate a gurukul-based education. Therefore, after 1893 the two wings
of the Arya Samaj were-DA V group and Gurukul group.
Munshi Ram and Lekh Ram devoted themselves to popularizing of the teachings of
the Vedas and began an Arya Kanya Pathsala at Jalandhar to safeguard education
from missionary influence. In 1902, Munshi Ram founded a Gurukul at Kangri in
Haridwar. This institute became the centre of the gurukul education wing of the Arya
Samaj in India. It was here that Munshi Ram adopted sanyas and became Swami
Shraddhanand. The two wings of the Arya Samaj, i.e. DA V wing and the Gurukul
wing had differences on the question of education but were united on important politi-
cal and social issues of the time. The Arya Samaj as a whole opposed conversion of
Hindus to Islam and Christianity and therefore advocated re-conversion of recent
converts to Hinduism. This process was called shuddhi. They also advocated greater"

usage of Hindi in Devanagari script. In the 1890s, the Arya Samaj also raised the
issue of cow slaughter and formed gaurakshini sabhas (or the cow protection soci-
eties) for protection of cows. The Arya Samaj led a prolonged movement against
untouchability and advocated dilution of caste distinctions.
REFORM MOVEMENTS AMONG MUSLIMS
There was a sense of loss of power among educated and elite Muslims of India. This
happened mainly because of-(i) transfer of power from Mughals to British, and
(ii) replacement of Persian by English as the language of employment and advance-
ment in the new bureaucracy. The movement of the Farazis which arose among the
peasants of early 19th century Bengal advocated return to pure Islam. They followed
the teachings of Shah Walliullah of Delhi (1703–63) who had, a century earlier, talked
about regaining purity of Islam and objected to infiltration of non-Islamic customs
among Muslims. Founding leader of the Farazis, Shariat Ullah (1781–1839) preached
religious purification and advocated return to the faraiz, i.e. obligatory duties of
Islam, namely- kalimah (profession of faith), salat (or namaz), sawn ( or rozah),
zakat (or alms to poor) and Hajj. He also preached tawhid or monotheism. Another
movement which arose among Muslims of Bengal was the Tariqah-i-Muhammadiyah
under the leadership of Titu Mir who was initiated by Sayyid Ahmad Barelwi. This
movement also talked about return to past purity. Another movement which was more
concerned about the decline in power of the ulema class (Muslim priestly class) arose
at Deoband in the United Provinces.
Delhi School of Islamic Thought was derived from the Delhi College (currently Zakir
Husain College) which had begun imparting a parallel education- Islamic as well as
English. Beginning 1830s, the college helped to foster a modern consciousness in the
Muslim community. However, the revolt of 1857 and consequent crackdown by the
British forces ended this intellectual excitement. However, the urge for moderniza-
tion could easily be felt among a section of Muslims.
The new leadership was provided by Sayyid Ahmad Khan (1817–98) who rightly
thought that modern education was the most important path for improvement in the
condition of Indian Muslims. He called for the study of European science and tech-
nology. In 1866, he formed the British Indian Association. He stayed in England for
more than a year during 1869-70. On his return, he asked his Muslim brethren to
adopt some positive features of the English society like its discipline, order, efficiency
and high levels of education. He pointed out that there was no fundamental contradic-
tion between Quran and Natural Science and the new circumstances demanded dis-
semination of English language within an Islamic context. He founded the Moham-
medan Anglo Oriental College at Aligarh in 1875 which went on to become the most
important seminary for modern higher education among Muslims. At the elementary
level, students followed the standard government curriculum in a carefully constructed
Islamic environment. In 1878, the college classes were also started and non-Muslims
were also enrolled. In 1886, Sayyid Ahmad Khan founded the Mohammadan Anglo
Oriental Educational Conference. The Muslim graduates of Aligarh who numbered
220 during 1882–1902, provided lot of excitement to the Muslim intellectual world and
in due course of time provided an able and modern leadership to the community.

played a prominent role in the social life of the 19th century. One may mention such
names as Pandita Ramabai in western part, Sister Subbalaksmi in Madras and Rokeya
Sakhawat Hossain in Bengal. Reform movements  helped the growth of a modern
middle class which was conscious of its rights. Some Indian reformers also protested
British attempts to pass those laws which they thought interfered with their religion and
society.  This was evident in the case of the Age of Consummation of marriage by
raising the age of consent from 10 to 12.  We can also see that some of these reform
movements, by raising issues which were in conflict with interests of other communities
or were revivalist in nature, also worked towards polarization along communal lines.

18.3 RISE OF WESTERN EDUCATION IN INDIA
British rulers were keen to spread their ideology and culture in India. This could
strengthen their roots in this country. Besides, it would also create a class of Indians
who might act as reliable agents of the British Empire. English education was the
most important medium of achieving these objectives. Several attempts were made
throughout 19-20th centuries to popularize English education and make structural
changes accordingly. Initially, the Orientalist administrators and scholars like Warren
Hastings, Cornwallis, William Jones, Jonathan Duncan and others attached more im-
portance to Indian classical education but gradually their ideas lost ground. It was
thought that British Empire had to fulfill a civilizing mission in India and therefore
western sciences and culture needed to be popularized.
INTRODUCTION OF ENGLISH EDUCATION & CHARTER ACT OF 1813
English education was first introduced in India in 18th century through some charity
schools in Calcutta, Madras and Bombay for educating European and Anglo-Indian
children. Although the East India Company supported these schools in various ways
but it did not take any responsibility for teaching English to the Indian population. The
beginning was finally made in the year 1813 through a Charter Act. This Act al-
lowed missionaries to travel to India. These missionaries were always keen to spread"

western literature and teachings of Christianity through English medium. More
importantly, this Act asked the company to spend one lakh rupees annually for-
 (i). encouraging Indian educated classes, reviving and improvement of literature and
(ii). promotion of sciences among Indians. However, this clause was interpreted dif-
ferently by different people.
DEBATE ON MEDIUM OF EDUCATION AND ROLE OF MACAULAY
Very soon a debate arose about the choice to be made with regard to the medium of
education in India on which the company’s government was to spend. There were
impassioned debates between the votaries of Oriental and English systems. Things
started drifting in favour of English education when Bentinck took over as the Governor
General of India in 1828. T.B. Macaulay was appointed as the Law Member in his
Council in 1834. Macaulay was a great advocate of English education. He was made
President of the General Committee of Public Instruction. Supporters of English based
education or Anglicists, led by Lord Macaulay, emerged victorious. Macaulay issued his
minutes on Indian education on February 2, 1835. This message became the guiding
principle for introduction of English education in India. The government resolved that its
aim in future would be promotion of European literature and sciences through the me-
dium of English language. In future, all funds spent by the Company on education would
be for this purpose alone. This shift meant that now English education in India would
become an important medium for the import of western knowledge.
Macaulay was of the opinion that support to English education in India would create “a
class of persons Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste.” It was presumed that this
class would eventually become strong pillars of the British Raj in India. It was expected
that these Indians, trained through English education, would learn western morality and
ethics. When incorporated into the structure of colonial rule, these Indians would help to
strengthen the British domination of India. This was the “downward filtration” theory.
This kind of education was not meant for the masses but for the learned and affluent few
in India. This theory assumed that ethics of English education would percolate down to the
masses through these Indians. These trained Indians, when acting as teachers, could act
as the medium through which elementary education would percolate downward in re-
gional languages. Macaulay was convinced that with limited funds, it would be impossible
to attempt to educate the masses. It is better that a few English educated Indians act as a
“class of interpreters”. This class, by enriching vernacular languages and literature, would
help western sciences and literature reach the masses. This would enable British rulers to
spread western morality to Indian masses at a much less public expenditure. This theory
also saw education as a means to enable Indians to occupy subordinate positions and
function as clerks etc. in the Company’s bureaucracy.
WOOD’S DISPATCH
The most important part of the development of education in 19th century, especially
English education, was the guidelines prepared by Charles Wood, the Secretary of
State, in 1854, popularly known as the Wood’s Dispatch. This comprehensive scheme
dominated education policy in the second half of the 19 th century. It firmly put the
European model on the map of Indian education.
Its essential features:
• It declared the aim of education in India to be diffusion of European knowledge.
• For higher education, English would be the preferred medium of instruction while"

the vernacular languages would be the medium through which European knowl-
edge could infilter to the masses.
• It proposed a hierarchy of schools, i.e. vernacular primary schools at the village
level, followed by Anglo-Vernacular high schools and an affiliated college at the
district level.
• This Dispatch recommended grants-in-aid for the first time to encourage private
efforts in the field of education.
• It proposed to set up a Department of Public Instruction to be headed by a
Director, one in each of the five provinces under the British rule. This Depart-
ment would review the progress of education in the particular province.  The
Department of Public Instruction was established in 1855 and replaced the Com-
mittee of Public Instruction and Council of Education.
• It proposed to set up universities at Calcutta, Bombay and Madras on the model
of London University which would hold examinations and confer degrees. The
universities of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras were established in 1857.
• Apart from the formal education, the Dispatch underlined the importance of voca-
tional education and emphasized the need to set up technical schools and colleges.
• It also recommended setting up of training institutes for prospective teachers.
• It also supported education for women. Many modern girls’ schools were set up
subsequently and also received government’s grants-in-aid.
HUNTER COMMISSION
A commission was set up in 1882 under W.W. Hunter to review the progress made in the
field of education following Wood’s Dispatch. It was confined mostly to
secondary and primary education. The Hunter Commission made a large number of
recommendations. It laid special emphasis on primary education whose control ought to
be transferred to district and municipal boards. At the secondary level, there should be two
streams-one literary education which should lead to university education and the other of
a practical nature leading to a career in commercial or vocational field. Private initiative in
the field of education should be encouraged. It underlined the need to provide adequate
facilities for spread of women education outside the presidency towns. For the next two

18.4 GROWTH OF PRESS IN INDIA
The growth of press and journalism formed an important background for the rise of a
new consciousness during the modern period. The spread of printing technology meant
that books were easily available. In other words, widespread printing opened new chan-
nels of communications across India. This new printing technology helped the growth of
press and journalism. The newspapers began getting published in English language in
the late 18th century. During the 19th century, a large number of newspapers in local
languages also started. James Augustus Hickey published the first newspaper in India
named The Bengal Gazette in 1780. It was followed by a series of newspapers from
Bengal, Bombay and Madras. Some important papers were The Calcutta Chronicle
(1786), The Madras Courier (1788), and The Bombay Herald (1789).
These early newspapers in English were meant primarily for the European and Anglo-
Indian community staying in India. However, the Company’s officials were concerned
about news of their misdoings appearing in these papers. Therefore, restrictions were
often imposed. Lord Wellesley (1796–1804) imposed strict regulations through the Cen-
sorship of the Press Act in 1799. This Act warranted that all content was to be cleared
by the Secretary to the Government. Names of the printer, editor and proprietor were to
be clearly printed in every issue. Lord Hastings (1813–23) relaxed some of these laws
in 1818 and removed the pre-censorship of the press. However, these relaxations proved
temporary as John Adams, who became acting Governor General in 1823, imposed
some tough regulations on Press in the same year. License was made mandatory for
starting or using a press. The Governor General reserved the right to cancel a license.
The officiating Governor General, Charles Metcalfe (1835–36) was a supporter of free
press. He removed the regulations of 1823. Metcalfe’s Press Act just wanted publishers
to give a declaration about the place and premises of the publication. This liberating influ-
ence had a positive impact on the growth of press as a large number of newspapers
started publishing till stiff regulations were again imposed in 1857 due to the Revolt. Most
serious restriction on the growth of Indian language newspapers was Lord Lytton’s Ver-
nacular Press Act of 1878. A highly biased and racial measure, this Act attempted to
stifle any opposition to the government voiced in the local languages of the country. Similar
restrictions were not imposed on the English language newspapers. It was an important
example of Lytton’s conservative and arrogant attitude. It indirectly empowered the gov-
ernment to control all seditious writings by Indian intelligentsia. There was no appeal"

WHAT YOU HA VE LEARNT
You have learnt that British rulers looked at India quite differently. Policies made
by them were also influenced by their ideological inclinations. During 19th cen-
tury, a series of reform movements swept across India. These movements tried
to address issues related to condition of women, caste rigidities, evils that had
crept in religious beliefs of people, modernization of communities, educational
backwardness etc. British policy makers also tried to popularize English educa-
tion in India. This could be the medium for the import of European culture and
morality. This would eventually help them strengthen their control over this coun-
try. During this period, both the English as well as the Indian language press
flourished. However, restrictions were imposed at different times to curtail the
freedom of press. Social changes that occurred during the modern period helped
to prepare the country ultimately for a national liberation movement against the
British rule.

POPULAR RESISTANCE TO
COMPANY RULE
19
Notes
The early years of the English East India company’s rule in India witnessed a large
number of uprisings and rebellions. As we have learnt, over a period of 100 years,
starting from 1750s to 1850s, the English East India company adopted various measures
to transform India into a colony Different policies followed by the British in India during
this period were primarily in the interest of the British. A number of land revenue
experiments were made which caused hardship to cultivators. Local administration
failed to provide relief and natural justice to the rural poor. In this lesson we will learn
how the peasantry and tribal people suffered under the colonial administration and why
they resorted to revolts. With a brief narrative of important popular uprisings, we will
analyze the nature and significance of these uprisings. The Revolt of 1857 has a major
significance because, for the first time, it brought together people having different eth-
nic, religious and class background in a unified movement against the British rule.
OBJECTIVES
After studying the lesson, you will be able to:
• discuss the background to the popular revolts which broke out till 1857;
• explain the nature and significance of these revolts,;
• identify the issues that led to the Revolt of 1857.and
• analyse the importance and significance of the Revolt of 1857.
19.1 CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING TO POPULAR REVOLT
We have read in earlier lessons that the British rule in India had a number of changes in
socio-economic life of the Indian people. The industrial Revolution  (we will learn more
about it in  subsequent Lessons) made it necessary for England to look for raw materi-
als and markets in other countries. This necessity guided the policy of the colonial ruler
in India. Indian economy was geared to serve the interests of the British masters. Let
us recall some of the important changes in Indian economy during this period.
• A new set of property relations was introduced and land was made saleable
commodity.
• Private ownership of land was recognized and a number of intermediaries came
into existence in between the owner and cultivator of the land."

 POPULAR RESISTANCE TO COMPANY RULE
• Commercial crops were encouraged in place of food crops to serve the British
capitalists.
• Speculation and investment in land by merchants, bureaucrats and landlords led
to the growth of absentee landlordism.
• Growing burden of taxation made the cultivators an easy prey to the revenue
collections, merchants and money lenders.
• Transfer of wealth from India to England became a common feature.
• Local industries were suppressed   in order to make way for the British manu-
factured goods.
• Tribals lost their traditional rights in land due to the land revenue policy of the
British government.
All these changes dealt a serious blow to the rural society, particularly the cultivators
and tribals. For the peasant, the new changes in agrarian economy and social struc-
ture meant more intensive and systematic exploitation.
To recall it again, the colonial rulers were concerned only with the collection of rev-
enues in time which were fixed at high rates. Zamindars and others who were engaged
in collecting the revenue were least concerned about the paying capacity of the cultiva-
tors and forcefully collected the taxes. In meeting the increasing demand of taxes, the
peasants were compelled to sell their lands or they were caught in the trap of money
lenders. Justice could not be expected from the local administration because it was
under the influence of the rich. Thus, under the colonial rule, the nexus of the official,
the landlord and the money lender combined together to exploit the peasantry. Bengal
famine of 1770, bear testimony to the devastating effect of the British policy over the
rural society. Alongwith the colonization of the economy, changes introduced by the
British in local administration and society created discontent and resentment among
local population. This discontent at various junctures took the form of rebellion.

19.2 MAJOR UPRISINGS
Before analyzing the nature and importance of early resistance to the British author-
ity, it would be better for us to be introduced to some of the rebellions. From 1760s to
the Revolt of 1857, there were a large number of rebellions spreading over different
parts of India. We will discuss these rebellions in two categories – the peasant upris-
ing and the tribal uprisings.
(i) Peasant Uprisings
Growing burden of taxation, eviction from land and the Bengal famine led to the
impoverishment of a large section of the peasantry. Many of these people being"

evicted from lands joined the bands of Sanyasis and Fakirs. Though they were
religious mendicants they used to loot the grain stocks of the rich and the treasuries of
the local government. The Sanyasis often distributed their wealth among the poor and
established their own government. However, they could not sustain their struggle for
long in the face of strong repressive measures of the British rulers. Bankim Chanddra
Chatterjee wrote a novel. Anand Math to imortalise the Sanyasi Rebellion.
Peasants of Rangpur and Dinajpur, two districts of Bengal, were aggrieved by the
tyranny of the revenue contractors. One such revenue contractor, Debi Singh, cre-
ated a reign of terror by torturing the peasants in order to collect taxes. When the
British officials failed to protect the peasant, the peasants took the law in their own
hands. They attacked the local cutchheries and store houses of the contractors and
government officials. The rebels formed their own government and stopped paying
revenues to the Company agents. This rebellion was in 1783. The rebels were finally
forced to surrender before the Company officials.
In South India, the situation was in no way different. The dispossessed landlords and
displaced cultivators raised the banner of revolt. The poligars of Tamilnadu, Malabar
and coastal Andhra revolted against the colonial rule in the late 18th and the early 19th
century. The revolt of the Mappilas of Malabar was most significant. The Mappilas
of Malabar were the descendants of the Arab settlers and converted Hindus. Major-
ity of them were cultivating tenants, landless labourers, petty traders and fishermen.
The British conquest of Malabar in the last decade of the 18th century, and the intro-
duction of the British land revenue administration in Malabar enraged the Mappilas.
Over assessment, illegal taxes, eviction from land and the change in land ownership
right caused growing discontentment among them. Thus, they rose in revolt against
the British and the landlords. The religious leaders helped in strengthening the solidar-
ity of Mappilas and in developing anti-British consciousness. These Mappilas were
suppressed by the colonial rulers.
In Northern India the Jats of Western U.P. and Haryana revolted in 1824. In Western
India Maharashtra was a common centre of uprising and Gujarat also witnessed the
revolt of the Kolis. We can add more to the list of peasant rebellions. But let us look
at tribal uprisings.
(ii) Tribal Uprisings
The establishment of colonial rule also affected the tribal people. Living outside the
boundary of the mainstream population the tribals lived in their own world being
governed by their own traditions and customs. The colonial government extended
their authority to the tribal lands and the tribals were subjected to various extortions.
The tribals resented the entry of the colonial administration into their land. Take the
example of the Bhils of Khandesh and the Kols of Singhbhum (Bihar) who enjoyed
independent power under their chiefs. But the British occupation of their territories
and the entry of merchants, money-lenders and the British administration in these
tribal lands curbed the authority of the tribal chiefs. This led the tribal leaders to revolt
against the British rule and their target of attack were all the outsiders in the tribal
territories. The insurrections were suppressed by the British.
Similarly, the Santhals had been living in a large tract of land in the border of Bengal,
Bihar and Orissa. Their livelihood depended upon the flora and fauna of the jungle.
With the introduction of the British rule they were used to clear jungle lands and once
they started cultivation on these lands, they were forcibly evicted. Thus, penetration"

of landlords, merchants and money-lenders into their lands brought misery and op-
pression for the simple living Santhals. The oppression forced the Santhals to take up
arms, and they found their leaders in two brothers, Sidhu and Kanu. It was believed
that Sidhu and Kanu had blessings from the gods to bring an end to their miseries.
They decided to get hold of their lands and to set up their own government. The
rebellious Santhals were supported by the local poors like the Gowallahas. Telis,
Lohars and others. The rebellious Santhals ultimately failed in the face of the ruthless
suppression by the British.
19.3 NATURE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE EARLY RESISTANCE
The above narrative of the popular revolts makes certain points clear about the na-
ture of these revolts.
• Actions of the rebels prove that they were clear about their interest and about
their enemies. Some features of the peasant and tribal protest movements dem-
onstrate a certain level of political and social consciousness among them.
• In many instances local issues might have triggered off the rebellion. But in the
course of the development of the movement, its objective was broadened. Im-
mediate context of a movement may be the oppression of local landlords, once
the movement started, it ended up as protest against the British Raj.
• Religious belief, Ethnic ties and traditions played a positive role in mobilizing the
peasants and strengthening their solidarity. Very often their notions of their own
good old past inspired rebels to recover their lost past. Past basically meant to
the rebels to get relief from exploitation and oppression.
• Attempt was made by the ruling class to define the rebellions as a problem of
law and order and act of crime. This is complete denial of the peasants
understanding of their grievances and their right to protest. It is necessary to
understand the domain of peasant and tribal action in its own terms.
• However, the rebels did not have a future plan beyond the restoration of the old
order. In spite of their limited objective and narrow world view the rebels defi-
nitely exposed the unpopular character of the colonial rule.

In the earlier section, we have studied how in different parts of India at different point
of time, popular revolts posed a challenge to the British Raj. In 1857, we see for the
first time, peasant discontent along with protest of some other sections of society
against the British conquest, brought together various sections of the society in a
unified movement. The events of 1857 are regarded by many historians as early
manifestation of nationalism."

HISTORY
 POPULAR RESISTANCE TO COMPANY RULE
Reasons for the Revolt
There were specific grievances which actually precipitated the people’s discontent
against the British Raj and led to the Revolt of 1857. The Revolt broke out on 10th May
in Meerut, when Sepoys revolted and started marching towards Delhi to restore the last
Mughal ruler, Bahadur Shah II, on the throne. The Revolt started by the Sepoys very
soon spread to other sections of the society. Why did this happen? The British govern-
ment by introducing changes in the land revenue system and in the administrative struc-
ture made its rule unacceptable to the majority of the local population. Lord Dalhousie’s
policy of annexation and the doctrine of lapse, particularly the annexation of Awadh and
other parts of north and central India, created widespread discontentment among the
local people in  this region . Land being the major economic resource the various land
revenue settlements like the permanent settlement, Ryotwari settlement, Mahalwari
settlement, etc. introduced by the British in India had significant repercussions on land
distribution and distribution of power in local society.  The new land settlements were
basically aimed at increasing the government’s revenue earnings and creating a class of
local agents who will stand in support of the British Raj. All these had disastrous conse-
quences on the cultivators and growing revenue demands even compelled Taluqdars
and other chiefs to sell their land. Money lending and auction of property further added
to the hardship of the peasantry. Artisans and handicrafts men were affected by the
promotion of British manufactured goods and neglect of indigenous industry.
Besides the economic grievances, at the social level there was a strong reaction in
the local society against the British intervention in their age-old customs and tradi-
tions. Being guided by the philosophy of racial superiority a section of the British
officials was engaged in modernizing and civilizing India. People were apprehensive
of the social legislation introduced by the British. Particularly the abolition of Sati and
the widow remarriage act had a negative effect on the common people. These changes
were viewed as intervention in the local tradition and culture. Added to this was the
fear of conversion to Christianity. All these alienated the people from the British Raj.
The sepoys had their own reasons for resentment. The sepoys were unhappy for low
pay and racial discrimination in matters of promotion, pension and terms of service.
Soldiers who were basically hailing from the peasant families were also unhappy with
the new land settlements introduced by the British. It is true that the sepoys were
agitated for various reasons but an immediate provocation was their suspicion that they
would be forced to renounce their cultural ethos of centuries old society. Just before the
Revolt of 1857, there was a rumor of bone dust in the Atta (flour) ration. The cartridges
of the Enfield rifles, which had to be bitten off before loading, were reportedly greased
with pork and beef fat. This was perceived as an attack on the religious belief of the
soldiers-both the Hindus and the Muslims. Sentiment of the sepoys was well reflected
in a proclamation issued at Delhi,- ‘It is well known that in these days all the English
have entertained these evil designs-first, to destroy the religion of the whole  Hindustani
Army and then to make the people by compulsion Christians. Therefore, we, solely on
account of our religion, have combined with the people, and have not spared alive one
infidel, and have re-established the Delhi dynasty on these terms.”
Courses of the Revolt
Initial disturbances started in March, 1857 when at Barrackpore, near Calcutta, Mangal
Pandey, a sepoy, asked other sepoys to rise against the British military officers and he
killed the British Adjutant, Mangal Pandey was later arrested and hanged to death.
After that in May, 1857 at Meerut the regiments of Indian sepoys shot down the"

British officers, broke open the prisons, released their comrades and crossed over to
Delhi to appeal Bahadur Shah II, the pensioner Mughal emperor, to become their
leader. Rumour spread about the fall of the British rule and soon the rebellion spread
to other parts of north and central India. In Awadh, the sepoys proclaimed that sepoy
Raj had arrived. Dissatisfaction and disillusion against the British Raj brought many
local chiefs, peasants, artisans, civil servants, and religious medicants together in this
revolt. In Awadh, the revolt spread to Lucknow, Kanpur, Allahabad, Benaras,
Rohilkhand, Bundelkhand, Gwalior, Jhansi and Bihar. The revolt in these areas had
massive response among the civil population. Some important leaders of the rebellion
were Rani Laxmi Bai, Tantia Tope, Begum Hazrat Mahal, Nana Saheb, Kunwar

19.5 NATURE AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE REVOLT
Nature
Historians are of different opinions regarding the nature of the Revolt of 1857. British
historians interpreted the revolt as a mutiny of the sepoys. Ignoring the grievances of
the local people and their participation in the movement, the British historians felt that
the rebellion was engineered by the sepoys, and some landholders and princes having
vested interest. Recent researches on 1857 however argue that self-interested mo-
tives did not have much significance before the combined opposition to the unpopular
British regime.
Some historians view the Revolt of 1857 as the first war of Indian independence Those
who don’t agree with this interpretation argue that the rebel leaders did not make an
attempt to establish a new social order. They tried to restore the old Mughal rule by
inviting Bahadur Shah II. It is said that “Although Indian initiatives and priorities were so
central in the experience of change there was no national revolt in 1857. The discon-
tented were fractured in loyalty and intention, often looking back to a society and a
policy which were no longer viable”. Thus, it was not revolution but just a restoration.
Recent studies on the Revolt of 1857, however, focus on the popular participation in
the revolt. Besides the sepoys and Taluqdars, rural peasantry participated in large
numbers in the revolt. In the case of Awadh, it has been shown that taluqdars and
peasants jointly launched the attack. Even in many places when taluqdars made peace
with the British, peasants continued their movement. The sepoys had linkage with
their kinsmen in the villages and the revolt of the sepoys influenced the civilian popu-
lation to ventilate their grievances against the British rule. Thus the Revolt of 1857
took the character of a popular uprising.
Causes of the Failure of the Revolt
In spite of popular participation in the Revolt of 1857, the rebels were ultimately
forced to surrender before the British. Reasons for the failure of the rebels were:
• the rebels had limited supply of arms and ammunitions,
• there was a lack of communication and centralized leadership among the rebels,
• the British had sufficient resources and also better arms and equipments,
• the rebels did not have clear political agenda for future except their distrust on
the foreign rule.
• the rebels, in spite of the popular character of the movement had failed to enlist
the support of merchants, intelligentsia and many local princes that rather sup-
ported the British."

Significance of the Revolt
The British though managed to suppress the revolt but realized the extent of people’s
resentment. The events of 1857 compelled the British to re–examine their policy
towards India, after the revolt; therefore, they adopted a strategy to check the future
incidents of such a revolt. In order to win back the confidence of local princes, the
British made a declaration that they would no longer expand their existing territorial
possessions. Special awards were given to the loyal princes. In the recruitment of
army, community, caste, tribal and regional loyalties were encouraged in order to
check the solidarity among soldiers. the British took recourse to the policy of ‘divide
and rule’ by tactfully utilizing caste, religious and regional identities of Indian people.
Another important consequence of the Revolt of 1857 was the declaration of Royal
Proclamation in 1858. By this proclamation India’s administration was taken over
directly by the British Crown abolishing East India Company’s rule.
Finally, though the rebels failed, their heroic struggle against the British Raj left a deep
impression in people’s mind. The spirit of Indian nationalism which was at a formative
stage in the second half of the 19th century was greatly influenced by this Revolt.

2) Enlist any three major causes of the failure of the Revolt?
WHAT YOU HA VE LEARNT
In this lesson we have learnt that the establishment of the British rule in India resulted in
transformation of India into a colony of the British empire. Rural society was greatly
affected by this transformation. Being evicted from their lands, peasants became labourers
on their own lands. Different form of taxes made their life more miserable.Whereas
those who were engaged in small industries had to close their factories as a result of the
import of British manufactured goods. All these changes and unresponsive attitude of
the British administration compelled the peasantry to vent their grievances through
rebellions. Rebellions were not successful before the organized British armed forces.
However, these struggles paved the way for future challenge to the British Raj in India.
In this regard, the Revolt of 1857 is unique in a sense that cutting across the  caste,
community and class barriers, Indian people for the first time put up a unified challenge
to the British rule. Though the efforts of the rebels failed, the British government was
pressurized to change their policy towards India.

NATIONALISM

Notes
All of us at some point in our lives, have to be loyal to our country. This loyalty to our
country may be generally understood as nationalism. A nationalist is a person who
loves his country. You may find statements of this kind in novels and poetry, speeches
and newspapers and also films.
Have you ever wondered when all this may have begun? What is the history of
nationalism? How old is this idea? Or. did people always love their country? Does the
world ‘nationalism’ carry any other meaning apart from a feeling of loyalty for one’s
country? These are the questions that we shall try to answer in this lesson.
OBJECTIVES
After studying the lesson,  you will be able to :
• trace the history of idea of nationalism;
• explain the reasons for the rise of nationalism in Europe;
• relate the growth of nationalism in India with the struggle against British colo-
nialism;
• trace the emergence of ideas of nationalism in the field of culture in India and
• explain how nationalism was expressed in economic terms
 20.1 NATIONALISM: ORIGIN & MEANING
It may surprise you to learn that the history of this idea is not more than 200 years old.
Nationalism, in the sense in which we use it today, did not exist in India before the
19th century. It may also surprise you to learn that the roots (origins) of this idea do
not lie in the Indian history but in the history of Modern Europe. In fact it is possible
to talk of Indian nationalism as distinctly different from its European counterpart. In
order to know this difference it is important to have an idea of the circumstances
under which nationalism took roots in Europe.
In Europe the development of nationalism was the result of the fundamental changes
that were taking place in society and economy around the 18 lh century. The begin-
ning of the industrial revolution produced goods and materials and created wealth at
an unprecedented (unprecedented means like never before) level. This led to the"

need for the creation of a unified and large market where these goods could be sold.
The creation of a large market led to a political integration of villages, districts and
provinces into a larger state. In this large and complex market different people were
required to perform different roles for which they needed to be trained in different
skills. But above all they needed to communicate with each other. This created the
need for uniform educational centres with focus on one language. In the pre-modern
times majority of the people learnt language and other skills in their local environ-
ments which differed from each other. But now, because of the new changes brought
about by modern economy, a uniform system of training and schooling came into
being. Thus modern English language in England, French in France and German in
Germany became the dominant language in those countries.
Uniformity in communication systems resulted in the creation of a ‘national culture’ and
reinforced national boundaries. People living within those boundaries began to associate
themselves with it. Culturally they also began to perceive themselves as one people and
as members of one large community, i.e. Englishmen began to identify with each other
and with the geographical boundaries of England. Similarly it happened to German and
French people. This was the beginning of the idea of nationalism.
Let us understand this differently. Nationalism was the result of the emergence of
nations and nation states (large culturally homogenous territories with a uniform po-
litical system within) in Europe. These nation states did not always exist. The early
societies, with simpler forms of human organizations and without an elaborate divi-
sion of labour, could easily manage their affairs without a state or a central authority
to enforce law and order. State, as a central authority, came into being after the
beginning of organized agriculture. People generally found it difficult to manage their
lives without a central authority to regulate their lives. This need for a state became
even greater with the onset of industrialization and a modern world economy. An
elaborate system of communication and a uniform system of education with focus on
one standardized language created conditions for cultural and political uniformity.
Thus came into being modern nation states. These nation states, in order to sustain
and perpetuate themselves, needed the allegiance and loyalty of the people residing in
their territories. This was the beginning of nationalism. In other words, an identifica-
tion by a people or community with the boundary of the Nation, state and its high
culture gave rise to what we know as nationalism.
But this was not how the idea of nationalism developed in India. The conditions in
India were very different at a time when the idea of nationalism was taking roots in
Europe. Industrialization occurred here at a very limited scale. When Europe was
getting rapidly industrialized, India was still largely an agrarian economy. Different
people spoke different languages. Though the feeling of patriotism, (patriotism: love
and a feeling of loyalty for one’s territory and culture like the one that existed among
the Marathas for Marathwara or among the Rajputs for Rajputana) certainly existed
in India in pre-modern times. But nationalism as we understand it (unified system of
administration, common language, a shared high culture and political integration) did
not exist in India until about the middle of the 19th century.
Nationalism in India developed primarily as a response to the British rule. British rule,
as yon know, came to the Indian soil  in 1757 with battle of Plassey and gradually
established here by defeating the native rulers. As you are aware, the arrival of the
British as rulers was resented by many of the native rulers and people also. It was
clear that they all wanted to oppose and fight against the British presence in India."

 NATIONALISM
But initially they did not do it together or as one people. Different groups had their
specific grievances against the British and therefore they fought for the redressal of
their specific grievances. For instance the native rulers did not want the British to
take over their territories (as it happened to the rulers of Awadh and Jhansi in present
day U.P.). Similarly peasants, artisans and tribals suffered at the hands of the British
rulers and often stood up in revolt against them. (You have read about this in Module 3
of this Book). But merely the opposition to the British rule or a fight against them did not
bring about a feeling of nationalism in India. Although different sections of the popula-
tion got united because of common exploitation at the hands of the British, a feeling of
identification with the entire country and its people did not come about. Even the great
revolt of 1857, in which many sections of the population fought together (like native
rulers, soldiers, zamindars and peasants) did not produce a feeling of nationalism or an
all-India unity. The idea that the people of India, in spite of many differences among
themselves, had many things in common amongst them had not, as yet, taken roots.
Similarly the realization that the British rule was foreign and an alien rule which wanted
to subjugate the entire people and bring them under its control, had also not occurred.
The essence of nationalism in India, or Indian nationalism, was the realization that all
the Indian people had a common nationality and that it was in their collective interests
to resist the British rule. To put it simply, a combined opposition to British rule and a
desire to achieve national unity lay at the heart of Indian nationalism.
The objective conditions for the development of nationalism were indeed fulfilled by
the arrival of the colonial rulers and their penetration into Indian society and economy.
However, these conditions in themselves, did not create an awareness of nationalism
among the people. The consciousness of the idea of nationalism took a long time to
mature and made its presence gradually in the fields of culture, economy and politics.
In the following section we shall look at them separately.

20.2 CULTURE AND NATIONALISM
It was in the field of culture that the ideas of nationalism was expressed first. This
happened at two levels:
• Firstly it happened in the form of questioning some of the elements of traditional
Indian culture and a desire to bring about reforms in it by removing some socially"

Contemporary India
Notes
HISTORY
 NATIONALISM
undesirable feature of Indian culture like caste system, religious superstitions,
priesthood, discrimination against women etc.
• Secondly, an attempt was also made by the Indians to oppose the British en-
croachment in the Indian culture.
It is important to remember that the colonial conquest did not just mean the replace-
ment of one kind of rulers by another. Its effect penetrated deep down to the lives of the
ordinary people. In a variety of ways, through the efforts of British rulers and their
agents, the culture of then colonial rulers began to spread among the Indian people.
This spread of colonial culture and language produced two responses among the
Indian elites (elite: socially privileged people belonging to high culture and the upper
strata of the society). Some of them began to compare the traditional Indian society
and culture with the one that existed in Modern England. They thus questioned
some of the elements of the Indian culture. For instance social reformers like Raja
Rammohan Roy and Ishwarachandra Vidyasagar worked hard for the eradication
of some of the social evils that were a part of the Indian society. In particular
Rammohan Roy attacked the practice of Sati (burning of the widow along with the
husband on his death) and Vidyasagar advocated remarriage of widows. Leaders
like Jotiba Phule initiated anti-caste movements in Maharashtra. They also made
an appeal to the colonial rulers to intervene in the Indian society and bring about
reforms, although they did not believe that the European culture was superior to
Indian culture. They did. however, believe that the British rule represented a mod-
ernizing force which could help in the development of the Indian society along
modern and rational lines.
At another level, however, the Indian leaders tried to ‘defend’ and protect Indian
culture against what they thought was an encroachment of the colonial culture into
the lives of the Indian people. When attempts were made in the 1850s to impose a
European dress and other practices on the Indian people, it was resisted by them.
Interestingly this was also true of those social reformers who admired the British rule
and hoped that the colonial rule would, through legislation and other means, introduce
modernity in India. Thus Keshub Chandra Sen, a prominent 19th century reformer
and a leader of the Brahmo Samaj (formed by Rammohan Roy in 1828) did not like to
wear English dress or eat English food. Similarly Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar refused
to go to a function hosted by the Lt. Governor because he was required to wear
European dress. In this approach cultural rights and practices of the people were
seen as very important and the colonial rule was defied on the ground that it was
trying to impinge upon them.
The two approaches mentioned above may seem to you different and also in conflict
with each other. The former approach (of questioning the evils of the traditional
Indian culture) may look different from the later approach (of resisting any attempt
on the part of the colonial rulers to either appropriate or try to change the local Indian
cultures). It may appear to you that the first approach invited British intervention in
the Indian society whereas the second approach opposed it. But it is very important to
remember that, as components of Indian nationalism, both the approaches comple-
mented each other. The idea of cultural nationalism, as it developed in the 19th cen-
tury was based on a firm rejection of some of the negative features of the traditional
Indian culture by, or its integration into, the culture of the colonial rulers. In other
words the 19th century social reformers wanted the Indian culture to become truly
modern; but they did not want it to become totally western. In this sense they were"

opposed to both the traditional culture but also to the modern colonial culture. This
was the essence of cultural nationalism as practised in 19th century India.

1. Answer the following questions:
i) Name the reformer who attacked the practice of Sati.

20.3 ECONOMIC NATIONALISM
You have now understood what is meant by cultural nationalism and what was the
relationship between culture and nationalism in India. Let us now try to understand
economic nationalism. The origins of economic nationalism can be traced back to the
second half of the 19th century when Indian leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji, Mahadev
Govind Ranade and Romesh Chandra Dutt among others began realizing that the
British rule was economically exploiting India and that it was largely responsible for
keeping India under extreme poverty. From this a whole generation of Indian leaders
like Gopal Krishna Gokhle, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, G .V . Joshi and many others devel-
oped a systematic and comprehensive economic critique of the British rule. Following
are some of the features of economic nationalism they propounded and preached
through their writings:
They emphasized that the colonial rule was economically exploiting India in a variety
of ways. Initially this exploitation was confined to heavy taxation of the peasantry and
the unequal trade with India. It was an unequal trade because the British East India
Company (which was granted a monopoly of trade with India by the British Parlia-
ment) bought Indian goods very cheap and sold British manufactured goods to India
at a very expensive rate. This resulted in India’s wealth going to England. It also
destroyed the traditional handicraft industries of India. However, in the 19th century,
whereas this form of economic exploitation continued, new and more complex forms
of exploitation came into being. Now the colonial rulers exploited India as a supplier
of raw material for their industries and a market where the goods produced in the
British industries could be sold. India was made to cultivate those raw materials
(like cotton or jute) which were required by British industries. The impact of this
was that India’s wealth, which could have been utilized for India’s industrialization
and economic development, was utilized instead for Britain’s economic develop-
ment. The Indian nationalist leaders learnt these vital facts and propagated them at
the same time."

HISTORY
 NATIONALISM
• As a part of their understanding about a steady economic exploitation of India,
the nationalist leaders, Dadabhai Naoroji in particular, propounded the ‘drain theory.
Naoroji, in his famous book Poverty and the Un-British Rule in India written
in (1901 pub. 1988) argued that India’s economic resources were being system-
atically siphoned off to England through trade, industrialization and high salaries
to British officials which were being paid by Indian money. According to their
calculations this ‘drain’ amounted to one half of government revenues and more
than one third of India’s total savings. It was thus that Britain’s enrichment and
India’s improvishment were taking place simultaneously.
The early nationalist leaders thus argued that the British colonial rule, in a variety of
ways, completely subordinated Indian economy to the economy of Great Britain. In
their view the direction of the Indian economy was being geared to suit the needs of
British economy. They demanded an end to the flow of Indian wealth to England and
the industrialization of  India with the help of Indian capital only, so that it would
benefit India and Indian people. In order to achieve this, the nationalist leaders de-
manded self-rule, or self-government or Swaraj for their country.
The relevance of economic nationalism, as formulated by the nationalist leaders, was
two-fold:
• Firstly, it demolished the notion, generally held by the educated people in the first
half of the 19th  century, that the British colonial government was a benevolent
government and would ultimately lead to India’s economic development. Many
people had believed that, if the colonial rule would continue for a long time, India
would, in the end, become prosperous like Great Britain. The Indian nationalist
leaders were able to demonstrate that this was wrong thinking and that the Brit-
ish colonial rule was actually harmful to the interests of the Indian people.
• Secondly, economic nationalism laid the foundation for a powerful nationalist
agitation against the British colonial rule which started in the 20th century under
the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi and other leaders. These leaders took the
ideas of the ‘economic nationalism’ to the Indian people and thus mobilized them
into the national movement. Once the masses of Indian people joined the national
movement, it became impossible for the British colonial rule to remain in India.

20.4 RELIGION AND NATIONALISM
Apart from cultural nationalism and economic nationalism, there were other ways also
in which the idea of Indian nationalism was being expressed. There came into being, in
the second half of the 19th century, a thinking on Indian nationalism which was based on
religion. It was leaders like Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Dayanand Saraswati (who
founded Arya Samaj in 1875). Vivekanand. and Arbindo Ghosh who made Hindu reli-
gion and its ideas the motivating force behind Indian nationalism. They looked upon the
British presence in India as an attempt by the Western civilization to dominate the
Indian civilization. They were completely opposed to this domination.
These leaders were convinced that although the British had succeeded in conquering
India, the Eastern civilization was superior to the Western one. Bankim Chandra
argued that although the British had conquered India with the help of military and
technological superiority, Indians should not start blindly following it. He argued about
the uniqueness of the Indian society where the ideas of Western civilization could not
be applied. These leaders understood the Western civilization to be based on the ideas
of individualism (rather than spirituality) and found them to be completely unsuitable
for India. Vivekanand believed that the Western ideas had to be re-modelled accord-
ing to the Indian situation. He said: “In Europe, political ideas form the national unity.
In Asia religious ideas form the national unit.”
These leaders derived their inspiration not from the Western texts and other sources
but from the traditional Indian texts like Vedas, Upnishads and Gita. They criticized
the British colonial rule mainly on the ground that it was trying to impose an inferior
material system on India which was a land rich with spiritual resources.
This understanding of nationalism based on religion had a political aspect also. Lead-
ers like Bal Gangadhar Tilak wanted to take the idea of nationalism to the people.
They knew that religion was a very important moral force in the Indian society.
Hence they decided to use religion in the propagation of nationalist ideas. In order to
be able to speak to people in their language, i.e. religious language, Tilak introduced
the Ganapati festival in Maharashtra in 1893 to create a religious platform from where
nationalist idea could be preached and spread.
This understanding of nationalism based on religion led to two different kinds of politi-
cal mobilizations in the 20th century. On the one hand, leaders like Mahatma Gandhi
welcomed the use of religion for nationalist mobilization. But they did not confine this"

 NATIONALISM
approach only to Hindu religion. They used the symbols and language of Hinduism,
Islam and other religions too. Thus they tried to bring members of different religious
communities into the national movement and also promote unity among them.
The second approach was more exclusivist in nature and was reflected in the activi-
ties of organizations like Hindu Mahasabha and Muslim League. Whereas the lead-
ers of Hindu Mahasabha confined their activities only to Hindu, those of the Muslim
League appealed only to Muslims. They also did not develop any understanding of
Indian nationalism either by contributing to the unity of the Indian people or by engag-
ing in persistent opposition to British colonial rule.
In the end it is important for you to understand some aspects of the relationship
between various kinds of nationalisms that you have read in this Module. Although
they may seem different from each other, they actually had many things in common.
They were different from one another only to the extent that they followed different
paths so come to the same destination. They were also not opposed to each other in
any fundamental sense. They were all opposed to the British colonial rule but their
opposition was based on different grounds. The advocates of cultural nationalism
believed that the colonial rule had started encroaching into Indian culture which should
be resisted. The profounders of economic nationalism argued that the colonial rule
was economically exploiting India and was the main factor in keeping India back-
ward. Similarly leaders like Bankim and Vivekanand opposed the British rule on the
ground that it was tempering with the spiritual resources of India. All the three were
opposed to the colonial rule because of its impact on the Indian people. Their ideas
helped in the building of a powerful anti-colonial Indian national movement in the 20th
century which finally defeated and overthrew the colonial rule from India.

WHAT YOU HA VE LEARNT
In this lesson, the following points are worth mentioning:
• The idea of nationalism first took roots in Europe in the 19 th century and was the
result of rapid industrialization and the onset of modern industrial economy.
• Indian nationalism was distinctly different from its European counterpart. In In-
dia the idea of nationalism emerged only around the second half of the 19 lh
century.
• The idea of Indian nationalism was based on the twin idea of opposition to the
British colonial rule and a unity of the Indian people.
• The impact of the British rule was felt first in the realm of culture. It was argued
by the Indian leaders that an intrusion of colonial culture into Indian culture was
harmful and should be resisted.
• The early nationalist leaders pointed out the economically exploitative nature of
the British colonial rule and thus created what came to be known as ‘economic
nationalism’
• Simultaneously, many other leaders preached Indian nationalism which was based
on religion and which was motivated by religious considerations.
• This development of Indian nationalism with many branches resulted, in the 20 th
century, in the building of a powerful Indian national movement. This Indian
national Movement was based on the 19 th century ideas of Indian nationalism
and was backed up by massive mass participation. The active participation by
the masses transformed Indian nationalism into a powerful irresistible force which
ultimately forced the British colonial rule to withdraw from India. (You will read
about it in the next lesson.)

Notes
The History of our freedom movement is not a single homogeneous story. It has several diverse
strands that intertwine and influence each other and unfold into the narrative of a struggle of our
people for Independence. The efforts of the moderates led to legal and constitutional changes.
The zest of the revolutionaries led to heroic actions and an uncompromising struggle. The mass
movement brought to focus by Mahatma Gandhi led to widespread response from all sections of
the population. Each movement fed into the other and enriched each other and in the end led to
freedom. We shall study in this lesson these different movements and see how each affected the
other and led to the achievement of the common goal i.e. independence.
OBJECTIVES
After studying this lesson, you will be able to:
• form an overall idea of the movement India’s freedom;
• identify and place chronologically, the various strands of the movement and
• see how each section of the national movement influenced the other.
21.1 THE INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS AND THE EARLY
NATIONALISTS
The Indian National Congress was formed in December 1885 by a group of 72 politically
conscious educated Indians. Mr. A.O. Hume a retired English Indian Civil Service officer
played a significant role in its formation. Among its members were Pherozeshah Mehta,
Badruddin Tyabji, WC Bonnerji, Surendranath Banerji, Anandamohan Bose and Romesh
Chandra Dutt. This organisation was by no means the first such association of the Indian
people. The English educated class in India was slowly becoming politically conscious and
several political associations were being formed between 1875 and 1885. Dwarkanath
Ganguly of Calcutta, Ranade and GV Joshi of Poona, KT Telang of Bombay and G
Subramaniya Iyer, Viraraghavachari of Madras were already associated with regional
political associations. The names of their organizations were Indian Association, Poona
Sarvajanik Sabha, Bombay Presidency Association, and Madras Mahajan Sabha, respec-
tively. The agenda of these associations was limited and far from the ideal of complete
independence. These associations were raising their voice against policies of the colonial
regime that might be inimical to the interests of Indians. The primary issues of concern
taken up by the early nationalists belonging to these associations were as follows:"

HISTORY
 INDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT
(a) cotton import duties to be made favourable for Indians
(b) Indianization of government services
(c) Opposition to Afghan policy of the British Government
(d) Opposition to Vernacular Press Act and control over the press
What made the Indian National Congress (INC) different from the other associations
was its attempt to provide a common political platform for the people of India which
enabled it to claim that it represented the country. Although the British administrators
attempted to play down the significance of the INC, it did manage to reflect the
aspirations of the people. Thus the most important and the foremost objective of this
organization was to create the consciousness among the people of belonging to a
single nation. The task was daunting because of the existence of diverse cultural,
linguistic and religious traditions of the land. All the different forces had to be brought
together against the common adversary, the British imperialism.
At first the founders of the INC had hoped to influence the colonial government in
matters that affected the well–being of the country and specially its economic
upliftment. They expected that if the problems of’ the nation were brought to light
through proper propaganda, the colonial government would take steps to improve
matters. Thus in the initial years through lectures, writings in newspapers the nation-
alists put forward the main problems of the nation and ways in which they could be
remedied. The most valuable contribution of the so called ‘moderates’ or the initial
members of the Congress was to formulate an economic critique. Firstly Dadabhai
Naoroji and thereafter other nationalists found that instead of bringing about an indus-
trial revolution, which the Indian intelligentsia were expecting, the British rule was
making the nation poorer and was, destroying its indegenous handicraft production.
This discovery led to some disillusionment among the early nationalists who had hoped
that India would be modernized as a result of British rule. The other concerns of the
early Congress were as follows:
(i) The reform of Supreme and Local Legislative Councils with greater powers for
Indian representatives
(ii) Indianization of the Civil Services with simultaneous examinations to be held in
England and India.
(iii) Changes in the forest laws that affected the Indian people
(iv) Organization of campaigns against indentured labour in Assam tea plantations
Slowly, there came to the fore other younger leaders who realised that colonial rule
would bring no positive gains for India and her people and the end of colonial rule was
the only way in which India can progress. Thus was born a new group of leaders who
condemned the ‘moderates’ for their methods of appeal and petition. Aurobindo Ghosh,
Aswinikumar Dutt, Lajpat Rai, BG Tilak,were the new breed of leaders who sought
to generate mass support for their goal of Swaraj and Swadeshi.
21.2 SWADESHI AND BOYCOTT: THE EXTREMIST POLITICS
The phase between 1885–1905 is known as the period of the moderates. In 1905
Lord Curzon, the then Governor general announced the partition of Bengal. The
province of Bengal at that time comprised of the present states of West Bengal, Bihar"

was indeed a very large administrative unit. However the way the partition was done
clearly showed the divisive policies of the British. Firstly, it was on the lines of religion,
where the areas where Hindus were in a majority, were separated from Muslim majority
areas. Moreover the urban bases of the resurgent intelligentsia (English educated upper
caste Indian), were separated from the mainly cultivating areas, (most significantly the
jute producing areas), was also an attempt to reduce the significance of Calcutta where
the intelligentia from all over Bengal met and inspired each other. There were widespread
protests following this announcement. Initially the protest was on the lines of the ‘prayer
and petition’ tactics of the moderates whereby petitions and memoranda were addressed
to the colonial government, and speeches, public meetings and press campaigns were
held. This was an attempt to influence the public opinion in India and in England. In spite
of these attempts the partition of Bengal was announced in July 1905.
As soon as the final announcement was made Bengal broke out in protest. Protest
meetings were held all over Bengal and most significantly not only in Calcutta but also
in the smaller towns in the interiors of Bengal e.g. Dinajpur, Pabna, Faridpur, Dacca,
Barisal etc. The decision to ‘boycott’ British goods was taken up for the first time in
one of these meetings. Formal proclamation of the Swadeshi movement was made
on August 7 1905 with the passing of the ‘Boycott’ resolution in a meeting at the
Calcutta townhall which brought about the unification of the hitherto dispersed lead-
ership. On the day the partition was put into effect i.e. October 16, 1905, a hartal was
called in Calcutta and a day of mourning was declared. People fasted and no fire was
lit in the cooking hearth. People paraded the streets singing Bande Mataram. The
people of Bengal tied rakhis on each others’ wrist as a symbol of solidarity.
This peculiar form of mass protest of ‘swadeshi and boycott’ attained popularity
among the new members of the Congress who were more impatient than the moder-
ates to see a positive response to their efforts. Lokmanya Tilak took the message of
swadeshi and the boycott of foreign goods to Bombay and Pune; Ajit Singh and
Lajpat Rai to Punjab and other parts of Northan India: Syed Haider Raza to Delhi and
Chidambaram Pillai to Madras presidency which was also motivated by Bipin Chandra
Pal’s extensive lecture tours. The INC formally took up the swadeshi call in its Benaras
session of 1905 presided over by GK Gokhale. Although the Congress supported the
swadeshi movement in Bengal it did not envisage the further intensification of the
movement throughout India or the extention of the cause to total independence. The
extremist leadership of Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal, Lala Lajpat Rai, Aurobindo Ghosh
etc wanted just that. This extremist pressure promoted Dada Bhai Naoroji in his
presidential address in Calcutta session of the Congress to say that the ultimate goal
of the INC was ‘self-government or swaraj’.
The contribution of the swadeshi movement was the initiation of new forms of pro-
test. Some of these terms of protest anticipated many of the methods adopted by
Mahatma Gandhi during his satyagraha. These new forms of protest were mass
meetings, processions, boycott of foreign goods (later extended to boycott of govern-
ment schools, colleges, courts, titles and government services), and organization of
strikes, burning of foreign goods in public, picketing of shops selling foreign goods.
Attempts were made to achieve mass mobilization and ‘samitis’ were formed which
penetrated deep into the interiors of Bengal spreading the swadeshi message.
For the first time in the national movement there was the use of traditional and popu-
lar festivals to reach the people. The Ganapati and Shivaji festivals in Maharashtra"

were employed by Tilak to draw the masses to the movement and educate them
about it. In Bengal the use of swadeshi songs was made to inspire the people. The
popular theatre form known as jatra was also used to spread nationalist feeling. This
movement was accompanied by a great out-burst of cultural activities.
Finally the colonial government was compelled to withdraw the partition in the form in
which they had envisaged it. However they did try to decrease the importance of
Calcutta and hence the intellectuals of Bengal by shifting the capital to Delhi in 1911.

21.3 FIRST PHASE OF THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT IN
          INDIA  AND ABROAD
The rift between the moderates and extemists grew wider and wider within the Con-
gress. The Extremists were in favour of boycott of the assembly elections to be
conducted under the constitutional reforms introduced by the colonial government.
The moderates wanted to participate in the electoral process however limited. Finally
the rift resulted in the split in the Congress in the Surat session of the Congress, 1907.
The extremist leaders continued to mobilise the masses while the Congress tried to
influence the government policies. The Morely- Minto reforms of 1909 were a blow
to the aspirations of the moderates. The swadeshi movement had lost its momentum.
However the revolutionary message of the movement inspired another more indi-
vidualistic kind of protest i.e. the revolutionary movement.
The revolutionary goal was the end of British rule through extreme self sacrifice.
Their methods were to assassinate unpopular colonial officials who were responsible
for giving shape to the repressive acts of the Government. The colonial response to
the mass movements was always two fold. On the one hand it gave concessions to
the leaders by undertaking constitutional reforms and inviting them to participate in
the limited elections, on the other hand there was large scale repression mainly through
arrest of key leaders. The extremist leadership spent several years in jails. Their
being in and out of jails resulted in the revolutionary movement largely being under-
ground, operated by secret organizations. These organizations had their genesis in the
samitis of the Swadeshi days.
In 1908 Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki threw a bomb at a carriage that was
occupied, they believed, by Kingsford, the unpopular judge of Muzzafarpur. However"

they killed two English ladies in his place. Chaki shot himself and Khudiram was
hanged. The revolutionaries who mainly belonged to the Anushilan and Yugantar
samitis, also undertook swadeshi dacoities to raise funds for their movement. The
revolutionary movement was not confined to Bengal. Rasbehari Bose and
Sachindranath Sanyal setup a revolutionary network spanning Punjab, Uttar Pradesh
and Delhi areas. In 1912 these two revolutionaries made an unsuccessful attempt on
the life of the Viceroy Lord Hardinge in Delhi.
The Revolutionary movement had also started slowly spreading beyond the shores of
India. Shyamji Krishnaverma had started in 1905 a centre for Indian students in
London called India House. In 1907 this organization was taken over by a revolution-
ary group under VD Sarvarkar. Madanlal Dhingra of this organization assassinated
the India Office bureaucrat Curzon-Wyllie in London in 1909. In Europe (Paris and
Geneva) Madame Cama a Parsi revolutionary established contacts with French social-
ists and brought out the revolutionary journal Bande Mataram. In Berlin, Virendranath
Chattopadhay and others operated since 1909. In Britain and Europe the revolutionary
groups were fairly isolated. However the movement found something of a mass base in
the United States of America, specially in the states of British Columbia and those along
the Pacific coast. These states had a population of 15000 Indians mainly of the Sikh
community who were facing considerable amount of racial discrimination in spite of
being successful traders and workers. Amongst this population began the Ghadr Move-
ment in 1913 in the city of San Francisco. The movement was founded by Sohan Singh
Bhakna and Har Dayal was one of its most prominent leaders.
The First World War began in 1914, and the revolutionaries saw in this a very good
opportunity in pushing through their agenda of complete independence. Britain was
busy in preparation for war and troops from India were sent out for this purpose.
Enemy nations like Germany would be only too willing to give funds for revolutionary
activities to weaken Britain. Britains aggression on Turkey brought the support of pan
Islamists as Turkey was the seat of the Khalifa revered by Muslims the world over.
Barkatulla was one of the important Muslim revolutionary leaders who joined the
Ghadr movement. At Deoband, in an Islamic centre of learning in Uttar Pradesh a
group of learned men, or Ulema, also preached the revolutionary message which had
a large following among Muslims.
Meanwhile swadeshi dacoities and the assassination of Englishmen continued and
there was a marked increase in revolutionary activity at this time. The Bengal revo-
lutionary outfits united under Jatin Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin) and planned large scale
disruption of rail communications and seizure of arms. They were successful when a
large arm and ammunition of the Rhoda firms in Calcutta came into their hands.
However their long-term plans were cut short due to the capture of Bhagha Jatin by
the police in Balasore, Orissa. Ras Behari Bose and Sachin Sanyal plan was also a
part of the Bengal revolutionary movement. This group established contact with the
Ghadr movement. The Ghadrites had started coming back to India in large numbers.
The Komagata Maru incident further inflamed passions. The ship Komagata Maru
carrying Sikh and Muslim passengers to Canada was turned away by the Canadian
government and reached Calcutta in September 1914. The passengers clashed with
the police and 22 people were killed.
The Ghadr movement and the revolutionary plans were unsuccessful because the
British government came down with a heavy hand on them. Most of the Ghadrites
who returned were immediately arrested. The attempt to incite mutiny in several"

army units was foiled and Ras Behari Bose fled to Japan and Sachin Sanyal was
transported for life. The revolutionaries and specially the Ghadrites were the pioneers
of organizing revolution among the army units and among peasants.
21.4 HOME RULE MOVEMENT
Balgangadhar Tilak who served a jail sentence from 1908-1914, returned to the Con-
gress which had now become more open to him after the disappointment of the
Council elections under the Morley Minto reforms. By 1914-15 the swadeshi move-
ment, the efforts at council entry and influencing the administration from within and
the revolutionary movement had all spent themselves. It was a time for a new thrust
to the national movement that was to come from the Home Rule Movement of Annie
Besant and Tilak. Tilak worked from within the Congress to set up a kind of agitational
network through his Home Rule League, which he set up in April 1916. At about the
same time Theosophist leader Annie Besant rose to great prominence and proposed to
start agitation for a great measure of self-government for the Indians. Besant also
proposed to set up a Home Rule League in the country modeled on the Irish Home Rule
movement to spread awareness. Besant’s League was set up in September 1916.
Tilak’s League was active in Maharashtra and Karnataka. Besant’s League, with its
headquarters in Adyar, Madras had more of an all India following. The activities of
the Home Rule Leagues were to organize discussions and reading rooms in cities, to
circulate pamphlets and conduct lecture tours to sway public opinion. The Home Rule
movement never spelled out the goal of complete independence, however they did
focus on the oppression of colonial policy through its opposition to government policy,
e.g., forest laws, liquor laws etc. A new generation of leaders of the nationalist move-
ment was formed during this time and the focus of the movement shifted from Bengal
and Punjab to Maharashtra and the South. Many moderate Congressmen also joined
the Home Rule movement. However, the Home Rule movement came to an abrupt
end after 1918.

forth local self-government and considerable autonomy to Indians, they kept the real
powers firmly in British hands. The system of dyarchy as introduced by these
reforms gave greater representation to Indians and greater control of local expendi-
ture. However the elected legislature had no control over the executive.
The post war years (the First World War ended in 1918) saw growing unrest in the
country as the impact of the War on the economy of India became more apparent. War
led to rise in the prices, scarcity, unemployment etc added to which there was an influenza
epidemic. Wartime necessities had given rise to a class of entrepreneurs in India and a
large working class was also created that was becoming more organized. This working
class was restive and a potential force in the nationalist movement. Part of the capitalist
class was loyal to the colonial state because it helped them control the labour force.
However there were also some among them who were supportive of the national move-
ment. They were opposed to the economic policies of the colonial government and realised
that the end result of British policy would be to the detriment of Indian industry.
The arrival of MK Gandhi in these turbulent times marked yet another phase in the
nationalist movement. Gandhi who arrived in India in 1915, used his own methods to
harness these forces that existed in India in the post war years. His style was to
address specific issues and laws and organize a peaceful resistance and violation of
the laws with the help of disciplined cadres. The significance of Gandhi’s movement
was that he brought the focus upon specific issues. Gandhi first achieved success in
three movements in Champaran Kheda and Ahmedabad respectively. The first two
were peasant movements and the last was a strike of the millworkers of Ahmedabad.
The peasantry at Champaran was agitating against the European planters who forced
them to cultivate indigo. There was a history of peasant unrest against planters in
Champaran. Raj Kumar Shukla, one of the peasant leaders, went all the way to Lucknow
to invite Gandhi to see their plight. Gandhi instituted an open enquiry into the matter in
1917. The Champaran movement also got wider publicity with the government trying to
restrict Gandhi’s entry into that area and later letting him go there on threat of satyagraha.
The outcome of the Champaran movement was that the tinkathia system, under which
the farmers had to cultivate indigo in 3/20th of their holdings, was abolished.
The next movement Gandhi associated himself with was the agitation of the mill
workers at Ahmedabad. The dispute between the workers and the owners had oc-
curred due to the withdrawal of the ‘plague bonus’. The owners withdrew the bonus
after the epidemic had passed and the workers opposed the withdrawal because of
the rising prices after the War. Gandhi persuaded the workers and owners to negoti-
ate before a tribunal. The owners suddenly withdrew from the arbitration on the
pretext of a strike called by some workers and declared that they were ready to give
only 20% bonus and threatened dismissal to those workers who did not comply. Gandhi
was greatly offended by this breach of agreement and declared that after proper
study of the production cost, profits and the cost of living the conclusion was drawn
that the workers were justified in asking for 35% increase in wages. Ambalal Sarabhai,
one of the mill owners was a close friend of Gandhi and had given a liberal donation
to his ashram at Sabarmati, and his sister Anasuya Ben was one of his greatest
supporters in the Ahmedabad mill workers struggle. During the last stages of this
struggle Gandhi for the first time used the fast as a means of protest. Gandhi ob-
served that the workers were slowly losing their morale so he decided to go on a fast."

He declared that if the strike was to lead to starvation then he should be the first to
once more and the matter was resolved with the workers getting the 35% raise.
The third movement was that of the Kheda peasants whose crops had failed and they
were unable to get a remission of land revenue from the government. First, enquiries
were made into the situation, as was the norm of all Gandhian movements. Crop
yields were studied and it was confirmed that it had been one third of the normal yield
which made the peasants eligible for a total remission of revenue. Gandhi advised the
peasants to withhold the revenue. Vallabhbhai Patel and Indulal Yajnik helped Gandhi
in the Kheda district by organising his tour of the villages and urging the peasants to
stand firm. The government unleashed severe repression seizing cattle, household
goods and even attaching standing crops. After putting up a brave struggle however
they began to suffer in the face of repression. At that very movement Gandhi learnt
that the Government was contemplating a compromise by directing that the revenue
be recovered from only those who could pay it. Gandhi had asked the well off peas-
ants also to withhold payment so that the poorer peasantry may not surrender. On
learning of the Government directions, thus, Gandhi withdrew the movement.
The outcome of the Champaran, Ahmedabad and Kheda movements, that occurred
between 1916–1917, was that Gandhi was able to experiment with his method of
non-violent satyagraha. The movements helped him to test the waters so to say. He
cultivated his own core group of followers who would assist him and follow his orders
in the forthcoming movements. In these movements Gandhiji showed his special tal-
ent for reconciling apparently opposed interests e.g. mill owners and workers, keep-
ing his friendship with one and at the same time gaining the trust of the other.
The next significant movement under Gandhi’s leadership was the Rowlatt satyagraha. In
February 1919, two bills that would severely curb the civil liberty of Indians were sought to
be made into laws. The government wanted to pass these laws so that they may be able
to control the rising tide of discontent among the population. The laws would provide for
arbitrary detention and punishment without trial etc. In fact one of the bills was passed in
the Council and made into law inspite of protests from the elected Indian members. This
kind of restriction on the liberty of individuals might have been acceptable during the war
years. But the end of the war had given rise to the hopes of further constitutional reform
and a greater control of Indians over their own affairs if not self–government.
Having seen the futility of the protests from the Council members and others, Gandhi
launched ‘Satyagraha’. A ‘Satyagraha Sabha’ was formed that attracted many mem-
bers. It was decided that a nationwide ‘hartal’ or strike would be observed to protest
against the Act and fasting and prayers will be conducted. There would also be civil
disobedience of certain laws. The Rowlatt Satyagraha was the first nationwide pro-
test in India under the guidance of Gandhi. The people of India showed a great and
swelling resentment against British rule and the hartals became violent. 6th April 1919
was decided as the day of hartal, however due to some confusion it was observed on
30th March in Delhi and led to fighting in the streets. Punjab had faced very severe
wartime oppression due to forcible recruitment and widespread disease and other
hardships. Amritsar and Lahore were centres of this movement. Gandhi tried to go to
Punjab and get the movement back on the track of non-violent styagraha. However
Gandhi was prevented from entering the Punjab by the British government and was
deported to Bombay. Bombay and Ahmedabad were also experiencing disturbances
at that time and Gandhi tried to control the movement there."

Events in Punjab came to a head when two local leaders were arrested and the local
town hall and post office were attacked as a result. During the nationalist movement
a popular form of protest was to attack the symbols of British government, telegraph
wires were cut, post offices attacked, and Europeans including women were at-
tacked. The army was called and meetings and assemblies were banned.
On the 13th of April 1919 a Baisakhi day gathering at Jalianwalla Bagh in Amritsar
invited the wrath of General Dyer who was made in charge of the city. The General,
angered that the ban on public meetings was being flouted attacked the unarmed and
helpless gathering and had his men fire at the crowd for ten minutes and only stopped
when his ammunition was spent. No prior warning was issued to the people before
firing started and there was no escape other than the narrow pathway where Dyer’s
men stood with their guns as the Jallianwalla Bagh was enclosed by walls on all sides.
This incident left 379 dead according to a conservative government estimate. This
brutal incident was followed by even more brutal repression.
INTEXT QUESTION 21.3
1. Gandhiji experimented with which movement on his method of non-violent
satyagraha during 1916–1917?
2. When was Rowlatt satyagraha launched?
3. What is the importance of Baisakhi day of 1919 in National Movement?
21.6 NON–VIOLENT NON–COOPERATION
Martial law was imposed in Punjab after the Jallianwalla Bagh massacre. Inhuman
treatment was meted out to Indians e.g. men were made to crawl on their bellies in
the bylane where a European woman had been attacked. Although the Rowlatt
satyagraha had been withdrawn, the feeling of resentment toward British rule grew
even more bitter. The Montague Chelmsford reforms of 1919 frustrated the hopes of
those who still had any faith in the colonial government’s intention for bringing about
reforms enabling Indians to participate in the government.
At this juncture a large group of enlightened Muslim leaders emerged and they had a
special reason for discontent with the British government. The Muslims were of-
fended by the insensitive treatment of Turkey after the First World War. Muslims all
over the world regarded the Caliph of Turkey as their spiritual leader and they had
been assured that the Caliph will be treated leniently after the defeat of Turkey and its
allies in the War. However in the post war treaty with Turkey the powers of the
Caliph were severely curtailed.
Matters came to a head when the Hunter Committee that was appointed by the
government to look into the Jallianwala Bagh tragedy submitted its report. In this
report they upheld the action of General Dyer and all other kinds of repression. This
report enraged all the Indian leaders and the moment was ripe for the next movement
of protest. It was at this time that Gandhi contemplated a non-violent non-cooperation
movement. The non-cooperation movement was an expression of the growing"

HISTORY
 INDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT
resentment of all classes of the Indian people against oppressive British rule. Gandhi
took up three specific points on which the movement was initiated: (a) the Khilafat
wrong, (b) the Punjab wrong, and (c) Swaraj.
The call for non-cooperation first came from the All India Khilafat Conference at
Delhi on 22-23rd November 1919 at the initiative of the Ali brothers (Mohammad and
Shaukat). At the Allahabad meeting of the Khilafat Conference, a programme of
four-stage non-cooperation was announced- boycott of titles, of the civil services, of
the police and army and finally non-payment of taxes. Thereafter, Gandhi began to
urge the members of the Congress to give theirs support to the movement. In the
historical Calcutta special session in September, 1920 the Congress adopted a
programme of giving up of titles, a boycott of schools, courts and Councils and also
boycott of foreign goods. This boycott would be side by side with the establishment of
national schools and courts to resolve matters without taking recourse to the judicial
system of the government and the adoption of khadi. In the Nagpur Congress of
December 1920, veteran Congress leader of Bengal Chittaranjan Das lent his sup-
port to the movement. Although the movement was formally initiated on 1st August
1920, the Congress leaders support gave a new impetus to it and from January 1921,
it gained great strength. Within a month a large number of students left government
aided schools and colleges and joined national institutions that had been started in
different parts of the country.
Several well-established lawyers like CR Das, Motilal Nehru, Saifuddin Kichhlu,
Vallabhbhai Patel, C Rajagopalachari, Asaf Ali etc, gave up their lucrative practices.
This sacrifice inspired the people. Boycott of foreign goods, picketing of shops selling
foreign cloth were other forms of protest. Charkhas began to be distributed and
handspun cloth became popular among nationalists. Nationalist newspapers held ad-
vertisements inviting people to participate in bonfires of foreign goods. The value of
cloth exports fell to a great extent. Along with cloth shops there was also for the first
time picketing of liquor shops.
To the alarm of the British government Muhammad Ali in July 1921 appealed to all
Muslims in the British Indian army and declared that they must consider it morally
wrong to be a part of the British army and that they should not continue in it.
He was arrested at once. This call was taken up by the Congress and Gandhi. A
manifesto was issued calling all men (civilian and soldier) to sever all links with the
British Indian army. In the midst of this the Prince of Wales visited India in November
1921, and was greeted by a hartal in Bombay where he landed and also in the rest of the
country. Gandhi addressed a huge meeting on the day of the Prince of Wales’ arrival
and anti- British feeling was so strong that a riot situation occurred when the people
dispersing from the meeting came across the others who had gone for the welcome
procession of the Prince.  Gandhi had to go on a four day fast to reduce tension.
The non-cooperation movement was gaining strength progressively. In Midnapur district
of Bengal a movement was organized against Union Board taxes and a no-tax movement
was also organized in Andhra Pradesh. The refusal to pay taxes under the Gandhian
scheme was to be resorted to in the very last and most radical stage of the movement. In
the Awadh region of UP the kisan movement was gaining ground through the kisan sabhas
which were becoming more organized and a great threat to British rule.
The stand of the colonial government was also becoming more rigid. The fall in cloth
exports, the show of resentment from the students, lawyers, government officials,"

workers, peasants, plantation workers and attempts to influence the army finally led
to the adoption of repressive measures against the movement. Public meetings and
assemblies were banned, newspapers repressed, and midnight raids were conducted
at Congress and Khilafat offices. The Congress under Gandhi’s guidance was begin-
ning to chalk out a programme of civil disobedience at Bardoli. This move was how-
ever cut short by a violent incident at Chauri Chaura in Gorakhpur district of UP. A
Khilafat and Congress procession on being confronted by some policemen turned
violent and attacked the police. The policemen tried to take shelter in the police
station, however the enraged mob set fire to it and hacked to death those policemen
who came out to escape the fire. Twenty-two policemen were killed. This incident
occurred on the 5th of February and on the 12th Gandhi withdrew the non-cooperation
movement. This withdrawal proved that at this stage Gandhi did not want to lead a
movement which he could not control and it also proved that the nationalists would
heed Gandhi’s call, for though there were many who differed from him, no one thought
of defying his call for withdrawal.
Within the Congress party there was a difference of opinion between those who
wanted to enter the legislative councils through the soon to be held elections; and
those who wanted to undertake Gandhian constructive work in villages and preparing
for the next step of the struggle. Rajagopalachari, Ansari and others advocated rural
constructive work while Motilal Nehru, Vithalbhai Patel and Hakim Ajmal Khan wanted
to enter the councils and disrupt the business of the government through creating a
deadlock in the system. Rajendra Prasad and Vallabhbhai Patel supported the former
view while CR Das adhered to the latter view. Das and Motilal Nehru set up a
Swaraj Party in 1923 to contest the elections. The ‘No-Changers’ as the group of
Gandhians was called gained support with the release of Gandhi from jail in 1924.
However the Congressmen could not be prevented from standing in the elections
though they were made to acknowledge the importance of constructive work.
The Congress candidates did win several seats in the elections held in November
1924 in the Central Provinces and in Bengal. Initial efforts at disrupting the processes
of the Councils began, but whatever regulation the members did not allow to be
passed was pushed through by the special powers assigned to the Governor exposing
the limitations of the system of dyarchy. Soon the elected members began to lose
direction and were slowly beginning to be absorbed in the system. In Bengal, CR Das
suddenly passed away causing a leadership problem there. At this stage of the nation-
alist movement amidst political uncertainties and a lull in the activities under the ‘main-
stream’ Congress movement arose a far more radical group of activists in the second
phase of the revolutionary movement.
21.7 THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT: REORGANIZATION
AND REORIENTATION
The spontaneous upsurge of the non-cooperation movement released the great force
of India’s youth that were determined to wrest freedom. The youth of the country
had responded eagerly to the call of Gandhi and had participated in the non-coopera-
tion movement. The sudden withdrawal of the movement was a blow to their aspira-
tions. The secret samitis of the first phase of the revolutionary movement began to be
revived in Punjab and in Bengal.
The Anushilan Samiti in Bengal was associated with Subhas Bose and the Yugantar
Samiti with the JM Sengupta group. There was considerable amount of political"

rivalry between these two groups. Some smaller revolutionary groups began to be
formed at about this time for example the one under Surya Sen of Chittagong that
developed along much more radical lines. The most striking revolutionary action of
the time was the murder of an Englishman, Day, by Gopinath Saha in January 1924.
Saha had planned to kill Tegarb the police Commissioner of Calcutta and killed Day
by mistake. This incident resulted in the arrest of many nationalists.
Another centre of revolutionary ferment was northern India where Sachin Sanyal and
Jogesh Chatterji and others formed the Hindustan Republican Association in the United
Provinces and started raising funds through dacoities. The most renowned of which
was the Kakori train robbery in August 1925 that resulted in the arrest of several
members of the organization. This organization also established links with a group of
young men in the Punjab under the dynamic and brilliant student leader Bhagat Singh.
The Punjab group was deeply influenced by socialist ideology. Hence the organization
was renamed Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA). The aim of the
revolutionaries was complete independence and they had a vision of how the State
should be after the achievement of the same. They envisaged a mass struggle of the
people and for this purpose they tried to mobilise students workers and peasants.
21.8 BYCOTT OF SIMON COMMISSION
Amidst this reformulation and resurgence of the revolutionary movement and the subdued
state of the mainstream movement was announced the Simon Commission to formulate
further constitutional reforms for India. The all-white commission did not include any
Indian and thus it was clear that the forthcoming reforms, if any, would not fulfill the
aspirations of the Indian people. Dyarchy had already shown itself to be a great farce with
all the key decision-making powers still firmly in the hands of the colonial government.
The announcement of the all-white Simon Commission sparked off widespread discon-
tent and fanned the fires of the nationalist movement. All shades of political opinion in
India unanimously condemned the Commission as not a single Indian was included in it.
The Indian response to the Commission was a unanimous resolution by leaders of
every shade of opinion to boycott it. All the important cities and towns observed a
hartal on the day that the members of the Commission landed in India (3rd February
1928). There were mass rallies and processions and black flag demonstrations against
the Commission. ‘Go Back Simon’ was imprinted on banners, placards and even
kites. Black flags were waved at the Commission wherever it went. Needless to say
police repression was harsh and merciless and processions were attacked and not
even the most prominent leaders were spared. The most insensitive attack was on
Lala Lajpat Rai, one of the outstanding leaders of the extremist era in Lahore. This,
now elderly, leader was hit by lathis and he succumbed to this attack a few days later.
The death of Lajpat Rai created tremendous resentment against the British rule all
over. During this period an important development within the Congress was the
adoption of Purna Swaraj  or complete independence as its objective. Complete
independence meant a total severance from the British connection.
As a result of  the adoption of the Purna Swaraj pledge there was a rise of great
expectations in the country and similar independence pledges were taken all over the
country on 26th January 1930. There was unrest brewing in the country proof of
which was a railway strike led by the communists based in the Bombay-Nagpur
region. The Congress led movement started getting ready for a movement of civil
disobedience that would include non-payment of taxes in its extreme form. Congress"

legislators were instructed to resign preparation for the next round of struggle. Gandhi
however began with issuing an ultimatum to the
Viceroy Irwin on 31 st January, which did not mention anything about complete
independence, or Purna Swaraj. The Eleven points were rather a set of specific
demands that the nation was making from the colonial government. One of the
demands was for the abolition of the salt tax and the government monopoly of
manufacture of salt. The demands also included fifty per cent reduction in land
revenue, protection of textiles, fifty per cent cuts in army expences and civil
service salaries etc.

2. When and by whom Swaraj Party was founded?

21.9 CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE MOVEMENT
As there was no response to the eleven point ultimatum, the movement of civil dis-
obedience was launched based on the issue of salt. Salt was an item of basic neces-
sity for all and any taxation on it would affect the poorest of the poor, thus salt
became the symbol of the deprivation and oppression of the Indian people. Both the
masses and the nationalist leaders began to identify with the issue. On the 12th of
March 1930, Gandhi accompanied by 72 of his followers at the Sabarmati ashram
began a march upto the sea at Dandi. The dramatic Dandi march drew a great
response from people. Crowds of people greeted and followed the marchers all along
the way. Villagers spun yarn on charkhas, as Gandhi went past, to show their solidar-
ity to him. On 6th April, Gandhi reached the sea at Dandi and picked up a handful of
salt at the sea side launching a country-wide civil disobedience movement by break-
ing the salt law. All over India people began the illegal manufacture of salt. Through
careful planning and large scale recruitment of volunteers the movement spread from
one part of the country to another, from Madras to Maharashtra and from Bengal and
Assam to Karachi. In the farthest north there was a massive demonstration at
Peshawar, Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan and his followers the Khudai Khidmatgars or
the Red Shirts had been active here doing constructive work for some years and the
response was tremendous. The city came under the control of the masses for atleast
a week and the soldiers of the Garhwali regiment refused to fire at the unarmed
crowds. Nehru’s arrest on 14th April was followed by public protests in Madras,
Calcutta and Karachi. The colonial government was in a dilemma as they had not
expected the salt satyagraha to create such an upheaval. Finally it decided to act and
Gandhi was also arrested in May that only resulted in further intensification of the
movement. The most important aspect of the civil disobedience movement was the
widespread participation the youth, particularly students and also women. Women
picketed liquor shops and shops that sold foreign goods."

HISTORY
 INDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT
The government started to issue ordinances curbing the civil liberties of the people
and civil disobedience organizations began to be banned in the provinces. The Con-
gress Working Committee was banned in June and the Congress President Motilal
Nehru was arrested. Local Congress Committees were also banned by August. A
number of local issues also become a part of the civil disobedience movement.
In the midst of government repression and the intensification of the- movement the
Simon Commission report was published and there was no suggestion that India might
be given dominion status. This resulted in turning the most moderate of Indian political
opinion against the British. The Viceroy then extended the invitation for a Round
Table Conference and reiterated the intention of discussing the award of Dominion
Status. Motilal and Jawaharlal Nehru were taken to Gandhiji to discuss the offer.
However no headway could be made between the Congress and the government.
The First Round Table Conference was held in London in November 1930 between
the Indian leaders and the British but the Congress was not represented. However it
was evident that in any negotiation involving the British and Indian leaders on an
equal footing the absence of the Congress would fail to bring any results. The next
Conference was scheduled to be held in the next year. The Government released
Gandhiji on 25th January 1931, all other members of the Congress Working Commit-
tee were also released unconditionally. The Congress was asked to deliberate on the
Viceroy’s offer to participate in the next Round Table Conference.
After a lot of deliberation and discussions with the delegates of the First Round Table
Conference the Congress assigned Gandhi the task of negotiating with the Viceroy.
The discussions between Gandhi and Irwin went on for a fortnight. Finally on 5th
March 1931 the Gandhi-lrwin Pact was signed. The terms of the Pact were as fol-
lows–
(a) all people arrested for non-violent protest were to be released immediately
(b) fines that had not been collected were to be remitted
(c) confiscated land that had not been sold off yet was to be returned to peasants
(d) government employees who had resigned were to be treated leniently
(e) villages along the coast were to be given the right to make salt for consumption
(f) the right to peaceful and non–aggressive picketing was granted
On its part the Congress agreed to withdraw the civil disobedience movement and
also agreed to participate in the next Round Table Conference. Many among the
nationalist leaders perceived this agreement as a temporary truce. However many
were not convinced of the necessity of this settlement. This gave rise to the renewed
activities of the revolutionary secret societies and the more radical communist
movements. Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were executed at this time as the
communist movement spread throughout the country.
The Congress in the Karachi session in March 1931 while reiterating the goal of Purna
Swaraj, also in the same breath endorsed the Delhi Pact between Gandhi and Irwin.
Although the Delhi Pact had made no mention of independence, the Congress at Karachi
was preparing for the framing of India’s Constitution and it adopted resolutions on
Fundamental Rights and a National Economic policy. This resolution was one of the
landmarks of our constitutional history, where the civil liberties of free speech, free
press and freedom of association was worked out. Neutrality in religious matters, equality"

before law, universal adult franchise, free and compulsory primary education and many
other provisions anticipated Constitutional provisions of free India.
Gandhi set off to attend the second Round Table Conference in August 1931. Mean-
while the British Government’s stand was hardening in Britain and in India. Irwin was
replaced by Willingdon and the favourable attitude of the Home Government had also
changed. As a result not only did Gandhi gain nothing from the discussions at the
Round Table but on his return in December 1931 he found that new Viceroy did not
wish to meet him. It was as if the colonial government was regretting that they had
put the Congress at an equal footing with themselves by making an agreement with
them. The government had also arrested Jawaharlal Nehru and had repressed the

movement of the Khudai Khidmatgars in the North West Frontier Province by arrest-
ing their leader Abdul Ghaffar Khan.
Under these circumstances the Congress decided to resume the civil disobedience
movement on the eve of which Gandhi had requested to meet the Viceroy to negoti-
ate peace and the Viceroy refused. The colonial Government thereafter launched a
severe offensive the first step of which was to arrest Gandhi in early January and a
total curtailment of the civil liberties of the people. This was followed by the govern-
ment getting the right to appropriate property and detain the people. Armed with this
power the Government put all the prominent leaders of the Congress behind bars.
This was followed by a massive reaction by the people. Thus mass demonstrations,
picketing of liquor shops and those selling foreign goods, ‘unlawful’ gatherings etc
occurred in a large scale which was followed by severe repression by a Government
that was in no mood to come to an understanding with the nationalists. Jails were
filled, the Congress was banned, Gandhian ashrams were occupied by the police.
Processions were beaten up and scattered, people who refused to pay taxes were
beaten and jailed and their properties attached. The people of the country with most
of the leaders in jails and on their own initiative with ruthless rep from the government
managed to sustain this civil disobedience for more than two years. Finally in April
Gandhi withdrew the movement. This movement exemplified the moral strength of
the common people or India and the stronghold of Gandhi as a national leader. Even
at this stage the leaders arid the people alike, in spite of difference in opinion, obeyed
his decisions regarding the continuance of a movement.
21.10 INTENSIFICATION OF RADICAL AND REVOLUTIONARY
           MOVEMENTS AND RISE OF THE LEFT
The years between 1930 and 1934 was also marked by an unprecedented explosion
of acts of revolutionary terrorism with its focus in Bengal and Punjab. A total of 92
incidents were reported in 1931 itself that included 9 murders. Exemplary among
them was the Chittagong Armory Raid. In Chittagong a group of revolutionaries
under Surya Sen captured the local armoury, issued an Independence Proclamation in
the name of Indian Republican Army and put up a brave fight with the British in the
hills of the countryside for several days. The number of terrorist cases kept rising in
spite of severe repression by the colonial administration. The HSRA had also become
very active in the Punjab with 26 incidents reported in 1930 alone.
The freedom struggle was never confined to the single path of Gandhian satyagraha.
It contained the very violent and extremist revolutionary movement, it also comprised
of the socialist ideology that came to India after the Russian Revolution, it would also
include a military offensive. These different strands of the movement were by no
means isolated. Most of the revolutionaries had participated in the Gandhian
non-cooperation movement. In fact the Chittagong armoury was siezed amidst cries
of ‘Gandhi raj has come!’ Chandrashekhar Azad and Bhagat Singh’s revolutionary
groups adopted Socialism as did sections of the Congress under Jawaharlal Nehru
and Subhas Bose.
Socialism combined the freedom struggle with a clear cut agenda of social equality
through organized mass movements that helped to mobilise the working class. The
initiative of working out the ideology of the communist movement in India was taken
up by eminent men like MN Roy who interpreted Marxism and the ideas of Lenin to"

fit the Indian context. Seven Indians including Roy founded the Communist Party of
India at Tashkent in October 1920. Slowly the idea of Communism found favour
among many Indian intellectuals and even members of the Congress.
Subhas Chandra Bose was a unique personality influenced by a wide variety of ideolo-
gies and epitomized the spirit of the nationalist movement from non-cooperation through
giving up of government posts, to the revolutionary extreme, upto the ideas of socialist
thought and finally choosing the courageous option of military offensive. Bose straddle
all these different strategies and proved that there was in essence no basic conflict
between the different visions of freedom at work within the nationalist movement.
21.11 CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS AND THE CONGRESS
           PARTICIPATION IN LEGISLATURES
In 1935 was passed the Government of India Act that extended some concessions to
the nationalist movement by introducing more autonomy to the elected members in
the legislatures of the provinces. This Act also extended the voting rights to a greater
percentage of the Indian People.
The British after introducing the 1935 Act announced the holding of elections to the
provincial legislatures in early 1937. After the resolution of the dilemma within the
Congress, it took part in the electoral process and did very well. The Congress had
absolute majorities in five out of the eleven provinces. This win encouraged the na-
tionalist movement with students, peasants and the working class. They all made their
presence felt and soon there were movements among these classes even in the Princely
States that were outside the full control of the colonial State.
21.12 TOWARDS FREEDOM
Congress governments in different provinces remained in office for over two years and
undertook various measures in the interest of various sections of the people. Reduction
in rent for the peasantry, release of political prisoners and the lifting of restriction on the
press were some of the steps taken by the Congress governments. But above all it
indicated that the Indian people were capable to governing themselves.
Towards the end of 1939 all the Congress governments resigned. The second world war
broke out in 1938 and the Viceroy unilaterally declared that India, as a British colony was
a party to the war on the British side. As a marks of protest against this decision, the
Congress high command instructed all the Congress governments to resign.
With the resignation of the Congress ministers, an important phase in the national
movement came to an end. As a result of the non-cooperation and civil disobedience
movement, the national movement had reached out to new areas and groups. This led
to an erosion of the British control from the minds and hearts of the people. The
effective running of the government by the congress in the proving undermind the
British control further.
The second world war created a new crisis for the British. The War created a new
demand for various commodities like clothes and food for the soldiers. These de-
mands could only be met through extractions from the society. This added to general
resentment against the British and weakened their support base further. To take an
example, as a part of the requirement for the war, large quantities of food stuffs had
to carried out of Bengal. This resulted in a severe famine in Bengal and over three
million people died due to starvation. Thus the situation created by the second world"

 INDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT
war created tremendous hardships for the people. It also created an unprecedented
crisis for the British rule in India.
In these circumstances a constantly declining support base of the British, Mahatma
Gandhi decided to launch a final offensive against the British rule. Thus began the
famous Quit India movement in August 1942. In this movement no demands were
made from the British. They were simply asked to quit India. The British retaliated to
Gandhi’s call to ‘Quit India’ by arresting him and all the members of congress work-
ing committee. The news of the arrest of Congress leader angered the people further
who came out on the streets and attacked  the British government which way they
could. In the absence of their leaders people became their own leaders and attacked,
looted and destroyed government property. The government dealt with the movement
with severe brutality and many people were killed in police firing.
In the end of British government was able to suppress the movement only with the
help of large scale killings and arrests. According to official figures, the number of
people arrested by the end of 1943 was well over 91,000. Although the movement
had been suppressed, it became very clear to the British government that they would
not be able to hold on to India for long. The British themselves had realized it. Uptill
now they had ruled the country with the help of a support system that they had built in
India since the 19 th century. This support system had been eroded by the national
movement, through a series of struggles. Without the help of various sections of
Indians (peasants, workers, middle classes, rich people, police, army among others) it
was not possible for the British to rule India.
Once the British realized this they began to make preparations for a gradual and
peaceful withdrawal from India. From 1944–45 onward, they released all the Con-
gress leaders and initiated a process of negotiations for a transfer of power from
British to Indian hands.
And so it was that India became free in August 1947. The attainment of freedom was
a matter of great joy for Indian people. Indian people had won their battle against
mighty British imperialism. But it was not an absolute victory. Along with the freedom
of India came the partition of the land in two nation states-India and Pakistan. The
British government had always tried to prevent a unity of the Indian people. They had
never agreed that all the Indian people were one with common interests. And so,
when they left India they decided to divide the country on the basis of religion. The
Partition of India was also accompanied by communal violence at a very large scale.
The year 1947 is a very important phase in the history of India. It was a year of
triumph of Indian people as they achieved their freedom from foreign rule. But it was
also the year of a great tragedy for the unity of Indian people as the country was
partitioned into two separate nation-states.

WHAT YOU HA VE LEARNT
Following points are worth mentioning in this lesson:
• Indian National Movement was not the name of one single event, but a whole
series of political events, spread over many decades.
• Anti-imperialism and national unity were two themes that were common to all
the events and connected them with  one another.
• The early phase of the national movement was dominated by moderate leaders.
These leaders put forward a series of demands before the colonial  rules. But
much more importantly, they started the idea that the British rule was not leading
to Indian’s economic development, but rather the decline of Indian economy.
• The moderate leaders followed by the were extremist leaders like Bal Gangadhar
Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal and Lajpat Rai who introduced the idea of the Partici-
pation of masses in the national movement. The extremists led the swadeshi
movement which was launched against the British decision to partition Bengal.
• The end of the swadeshi movement brought the entry of revolutionary activities
into the national movement. These revolutionary leaders, such as Khudiram Bose
and Prafulla Chaki, wanted to fight the British government by violent means.
They also wanted to target individual British offices.
• Mahatma Gandhi’s entry into the national movement was the next major step.
Mahatma Gandhi initially experimented with his political methods through local
struggles at Champaran, Kheda and Ahmadabad. Soon he took the lead in launch-
ing a country wide struggle.
• Gandhi based his struggle on a non-violent non-cooperation with the British rule.
Through these methods he led three major struggles- non-cooperation movement
(1920–22), civil-disobedience Movement (1930–34) and Quit India Movement (1942).
• A result of these struggles was that the national movement gained tremendous
popularity among Indian people. It reached out to various sections of the popula-
tion like peasants, women, workers and students. National movement gradually
spread to most parts of the country.
• As the popularity of the national movement increased, that of the British govern-
ment decreased. The British had ruled India with the help of many Indians.
These Indians constituted the support system of the British rule in India. The
national movement succeeded in damaging and dismantling this support system.
• As the support system of the British began to be gradually eroded, they found it
impossible to rule India. The British therefore decided to initiate a process of
negotiations with the Indian leaders for a gradual transfer of power from the
British to Indian hands.
• The British finally left India in 1947. Indians become free from foreign rule on 15
August 1947."

• However, before leaving the British decided to partition India on the basis of

THE WORLD IN 1900: THE
NINETEENTH CENTURY LEGACY
22
Notes
When we learn about the past through books, films, television or the stories told by
older people, we notice the differences and similarities between other times and our
own. We are aware that certain material things and technologies that we use today
either did not exist in 1900 or were used only by small numbers of people. Yet in
terms of the organization of human life we have much in common with the people
of the year 1900. This Unit will discuss how people in various parts of the world
lived in 1900.
OBJECTIVES
After studying the lesson, you will be able to:
 visualize population patterns in different regions of the world in 1900;
 define capitalist industrialisation and understand its social consequences;
 explain relations of colonialism;
 visualize modern patterns of energy and resource use and
 analyse the emergence of modern political ideologies and mobilizations.
22.1 STRUCTURE OF WORLD POPULATION: 1900
The study of human populations–their rates of growth and shifting patterns of settlements–
is called demography.
In 1900 the human population was about 1.5 billion (150crores). China and India were
then, as today, the most populous countries. Yet in 1900 Asia contained a smaller
portion of the world’s population than it does today. Most of the people all over the
world were settled agriculturalists in 1900, which cultivated crops and animals and
lived in villages. In many parts of the world people existed as nomads, grazing herds
of animals, and many were tribal hunter-gatherers, although they formed a smaller
number in 1900 than a few hundred years earlier.
A steadily growing section of the world’s population lived in cities. Cities had existed
since ancient times in many parts of the world, but they were limited in size and
population. However capitalist industrialization led to urbanization and faster growth
of population in cities. By 1900 Europe has a larger concentration of cities than any"

other region in the world: more than 100 cities had a population of at least 1, 00,000
people, and there were six European cities with about 10, 00,000 inhabitants. Europe
and America had the largest cities, whereas in Asia and Africa large expanses of
territory contained few cities and many stagnated and declined compared to hundreds
of years earlier. Most of the large cities outside of Europe in 1900 were only 100 or
200 years old-like Sydney and Chicago-and were inhabited mostly by people of Euro-
pean origin. Some, like Calcutta in Bengal, grew under British rule.

rural, or living in villages and dependent on agriculture. Industrializing Europe, or
Americas and Australia where people of European origin had settled, either already
had or were close to having 50% urban population, i.e., living in towns and cities.

 THE WORLD IN 1900: THE NINETEENTH CENTURY LEGACY
22.2 INDUSTRIALISATION AND SOCIAL CLASSES
The process of industrialization began in Western Europe after about 1700 with bringing
together of large number of labourers near areas of energy and resources to produce
metals, and to operate machines that turned out finished products at a fast pace. By
1900 when big amounts of money began to be required for industry to operate on a
big scale, we see the growth of capitalist industrialization. Capitalism derives from
the word capital, meaning accumulated wealth and property, and those people who
have capital are called capitalists. Capitalists were directly engaged in industrial
production, trading, administration and banking. By 1900 most of Europe, America
and Australia had undergone capitalist industrialisation.
The wealth and property of capitalists came either from trade and commerce or from
expropriating the property of small owners. On the other hand were people-men,
women and children-who worked in factories and who did not have any property and
were dependent for their livelihood on their labour for which they got wages. Be-
tween them was a large majority which even in 1900 was not property less wage
earners, but which could not be called wealthy. Many were members of the salaried
middle classes: teachers, doctors, engineers, clerks, and in other services.
Most people by then also believed that the existence of such classes is normal and
would continue to remain so, and that the majority of people would accept these
inequalities as their situation improved. They saw that the transfer of wealth from
colonies would allow some benefits to go to the working people as well in the Euro-
pean countries. This did happen to some extent by 1900, and most people lived
better than their grandparents had. But there were also difficult periods of
unemployment.
By 1900 Asian and African cities like Bombay Shanghai and Dakar also contained
large numbers of businessmen, shopkeepers and other sections of middle classes, as
well as industrial wage labourers. But population here was greatly outnumbered by
landlords, peasants and agricultural labourers in the surrounding villages.
It is important to keep in mind a few other facts about capitalist societies in 1900.
Much of the raw materials and markets for European economies came from the
colonies, and this relationship was also one of inequality: it was not an equal
trading relationship. Within European societies landlords were no longer the
dominant class.
22.3 URBANISM AND KNOWLEDGE
Another characteristic of industrialization was that production and sharing of knowledge in
society became more closely connected than before with urban life. Cities and towns
were not only concentrations of industrial wage labourers, they also had growing numbers
of people engaged in jobs requiring education and literacy: clerks, managers, teachers,
government officials etc. Soon it began to be recognized that even industrial workers with
literacy and numeracy contributed to greater efficiency. Newspapers and magazines con-
tributed to it. Daily production of newspapers in 1900 exceeded one million copies in cities
like London, Paris, Berlin and New York.
By 1900 most industrial societies required that both boys and girls receive basic edu-
cation, at least up to the age of thirteen or fourteen. School teaching became one of"

the modern professions in which women participated in large numbers. There arose a
knowledge and cultural gap between urban and rural people. As a whole, adult lit-
eracy in some western societies by 1900 was between 60% and 90%, while it was
much less in non-western societies.

2. Were most of the world’s super-cities (> 10,00,000 people) in 1900 in Europe or
outside of it?
3. Why was there a significant ‘literacy-gap’ between urban centers and rural ar-
eas by 1900?
4. What were indications of high literacy in the world of 1900?
22.4 ENERGY AND RESOURCE USE: INDUSTRIAL VERSUS
NON   INDUSTRIAL AREAS OF THE WORLD
In 1900 not only did people in the industrialised and non industrialised world produce
different things, they developed very different patterns of energy use. Most produc-
tion in the non-industrial world in 1900 was driven by human and animal power. Even
on American farms plows and mechanical harvesters were drawn by horses, as were
carts, carriages and buses in the towns.
Industrial societies required new energy sources to run their factories, light their homes
and offices, and power modern means of transport such as railway engines and
automobiles. Thus Britain, France and Germany in 1900 were largely coal powered
societies, while Italy had begun to use hydro-electricity. US was relying increasingly on
petroleum fuels. By 1915 it was clear that cars would replace horses in transportation.
These countries began to realize that their economic and political strength depended
on sources of energy, and they began to exploit resources in their colonies. For ex-
ample, the British were engaged in oil in Assam and Burma; the Dutch were doing the
same in Sumatra and the Americans in Mexico. These factors determined their for-
eign policies.

while Holland ruled over the entire area that is now Indonesia. France, Britain, Ger-
many, Italy, Portugal and Belgium had colonies in Africa, Japan, China.
These colonial rulers tried to prevent Asians and Africans from acquiring advanced
technologies, and carefully controlled railways and telegraph networks in their colonies.
They also came down heavily on aspirations for freedom. They replaced the earlier
languages of administration with their own. They also initiated some educational poli-
cies with the aim of assimilating some sections of colonial society with the foreign rule.
They also prepared some sections of them for manning the colonial administration at
lower levels. They practiced policies of divide and rule, restricted development of mod-
ern economic activity and used education for purpose of creating a social gulf between
those educated in the colonial languages and those in the local languages.
The impact of colonialism and capitalist penetration altered social relations in the
colonies. They altered the pattern of agriculture to shift its priorities towards the cash
crops they might trade in. This pattern of production for export was greatly expanded
during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. For example, Indian peasants
produced opium that British entrepreneurs exported to China. Indian merchants too
had a hand in this. In other words both production and trade were geared to the
interests of the ruling power. As a result larger number of people around the world
came to produce things that they did not themselves consume, while they consumed
things produced elsewhere by others.
Such commercial patterns created interdependence but also dependancies because
of the hold of the ruling powers. Peasants in many areas lost food sufficiency, with
the result that although the total world production of food was higher than ever before
in history, the late nineteenth century famines killed millions of people.

large extent the result of economic and social transformations connected with indus-
trialization. The debates became widespread and different ideologies began to have
mass following and organizations due to the rise of print culture and other means of
communication. By 1900 print media in western countries and in many colonies as
well were providing information (and advertising products and services) to large num-
bers of people, but also shaping their political views.
Liberalism
Liberalism as a set of ideas began to emerge more than three hundred years ago when
nobles and people of substantial property (sometimes joined by poorer people) struggled
to regulate or limit the powers of the rulers. Liberals believed that individuals have some
‘natural rights’ including the right to resist oppression, accumulate property, freedom of
religion, right to express their opinions freely and so on. They believed that governments
and rulers must be made to respect these rights. They thought formulation of public laws
and constitutions were the best method of creating and enforcing these rights. These laws
and constitutions were the best safeguard against arbitrary exercise of power by rulers
and government machinery. They also objected to state authorities dictating the religious
beliefs of their people through national churches, as religion was a private matter. With
growth of popular movements liberalism was forced to acknowledge the extension of
political and citizenship rights to all members of society and not just the propertied classes.
These included rights to form organizations and participate in elections.
Liberalism is also connected with certain economic ideas. Liberals saw people as
economic agents, as producers and consumers of goods and services. They saw
these as important aspects of their personalities and self expression of individuals.
But to them it was not the labourer but the profit seeking merchants, shopkeepers and
manufacturers who were the heroes. Adam Smith, one of the major spokespersons
of economic liberalism, argued that such people, if allowed to pursue their own self
interest would contribute to common good. Economic activity if left to its own creates
it own set of supply and demand and this leads to fairness in society. They argued for
free trade. So for economy the best government is that which governs least and
leaves everything to the market operations.
By 1900 many liberals began to think that governments should intervene in a minimal
fashion by introducing some welfare measures for the poorer sections of society—like
education and health. But their basic ideas remain till today. They represented mainly the
interests of propertied people. Liberals drew their main support from professional and
educated people who were dissatisfied with traditional and arbitrary arrangements which
ensured privileges on basis of birth (i. e., noble lineage), and of the business and industrial
capitalists. They also won support of many working people who liked their arguments
about constitutions and individual rights, but did not understand that they were not at all
keen on economic equality or economic rights of the working people.
Conservatism
Conservatives came mainly from land owning and other sections of society who did not
like the abolition of privileges and restrictions which benefited them. They were from
land–owning classes, or merchants and traders who enjoyed state protection and mo-
nopolies which were lost due to free trade policies. For them the whole idea of natural
rights was disruptive because it destroyed the old traditional order in society, in which
each section of society already had its place. To them social order and stability were more
important than equality. They felt that while all may be equal before God, it was not"

desirable that it should be so in the real world as well. They saw the old social order as the
best defense against the chaos of the modern world which was causing upheavals and
conflicts in society. All the western states had strong conservative political groups who
participated in elections, and had influence in the administrative machinery.
Socialism
Socialists also criticized the liberals, but for things very different from the conserva-
tives. The socialists represented the interests of the working people, and argued that
in industrialist capitalist societies the old tyranny of the monarchy and the aristocracy
had been replaced by that of the propertied capitalist bourgeoisie. Some earlier social-
ists, such as Louis Blanc and Robert Owen believed that co-operatives of producers
would lead to more equal sharing of profits.
Others, like Karl Marx, thought that workers would never be fairly rewarded under
the capitalist system. This would happen only if all enterprises were commonly owned
i. e., if the state owned them for the equal benefit of all. Marx said that in a communist
society when all means of production were held in common and were not private
property, each person will contribute according to his/her capacity and receive ac-
cording to his/her needs. Social justice therefore required abolition of private prop-
erty. Classes would also cease to exist in a society which was equal. According to
him the ultimate goal of the socialist movements was the establishment of such a
society. Marx also said that since the ruling classes would not co-operate in this, a
revolution was necessary. There should be communist parties and strong and com-
mitted working class movements.
Thus, the Social Democratic (Marxist) Party in 1900 organised millions of workers
into labour unions, clubs and associations, participated in elections, and held a huge
block of seats in the Reichstag (German parliament). They were able to get passed
legislation to improve the lives of the workers. Marxist, socialist and labour parties
existed in many parts of the world by 1900, though they were under tremendous
surveillance by the governments and police of their countries who wanted to prevent
revolutions at all costs. In countries like Russia the socialist organizations were banned
and known socialists were imprisoned or exiled (as happened to V .I Lenin, a leader of
the Russian revolutionary movement).

5. Give one example of a country in 1900 where Marxists were very successful in

6. Socialists (Marxists) are the most consistent opponents of imperialism. Why?
Imperialism
The world of 1900 was one in which the more industrialized states had power over
the people and resources of the unindustrialized world. Many inhabitants of the indus-
trialized countries believed that colonialism was beneficial for the countries that were
being ruled and that the inhabitants of the ‘backward’ countries were being ‘civilised’
by foreign rule. Liberals in the ruling countries were divided over how the dominance
of their countries over the colonies should be maintained. Not everyone thought that
direct political rule was necessary: but none were willing to let go of the benefits of
colonialism and the control over resources in the colonies. In Germany the liberals
argued that their country’s industrial power depended on taking more colonies. In the
US many liberals said that their country had no moral right to rule over Cubans and
Filipinos, but hardly any US citizens criticized their government’s interventions in
Latin America. British, French, German, Belgian and American capitalists invested
heavily in economic activities both within and outside the formal empires. They there-
fore supported as well as influenced the foreign policies of their respective countries
and pushed for colonial domination of the rest of the world—countries comprising
Africa, Latin America and Asia.
The political groups in 1900 that had the most consistent anti-imperialist views were
the socialists, who believed that colonialism benefited only the ruling classes every-
where and was not in the interest of the working people anywhere. Therefore the
working classes of all the countries needed to unite to overthrow this imperialist
domination by a few countries.
Nationalism
Nationalism and national liberation ideology was an explosive force in the world of
the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In all parts of the world in 1900 competing
nationalisms flourished and became important forms of mobilization of people. Broader
notions of civilisational identity competed with nationalism in winning support of the
people. Both were important in Asia and Africa. Pan (‘All’)-Africanism and Pan-
Islamism fueled freedom struggles in the colonies. The Chinese and Indians empha-
sized their cultural independence as well as opposition to colonial policies in their
struggle for freedom. Popular participation in government was also an important as-
pect of national movements. Protest against colonial policies of the imperialist coun-
tries-economic exploitation and denial of self governance-formed the basis for na-
tional liberation movements all over the world. Most national freedom struggles of the
twentieth century thus engaged with ideas about democracy and also with ideas of
how national wealth should be produced and shared."

In contrast, within the industrialized, imperialist countries, nationalism became ag-
gressive and tied with support to colonial policies and domination of other countries,
which, as you will see in your study of the following Units, led to intense competition
among those countries and eventually to World War I.
WHAT YOU HA VE LEARNT
The century before 1900 was a period of rapid population growth, with the most
striking growth occurring in Europe and North America. Population growth in
these places occurred in tandem with industrialization. The emergence of indus-
trial society led to the formation and solidification of ideologies – sets of ideas
and principles about achievement of the desired social order. By 1900, ideologies
we beginning to shape the struggles of people in non-industrial societies for lib-
eration from empires. In particular, nationalism and socialism were to have an
explosive impact within ‘developed’ Europe as well as in the ‘undeveloped’
colonial world.

3. Early in the 1800s conservatives were mostly members of the land –owning
classes or their dependents while liberals were often active in manufacturing and
commerce. By 1900, members of the traditional land-owning class had com-
bined with business people to support liberalism. Meanwhile, some traditional
‘liberals’ came to support conservatism.
4. Marxists believed human inequality was due to access or lack of access to the
means of production. By eliminating private property and putting resources un-

where.

WORLD WAR I AND THE RUSSIAN
REVOLUTION
23
Notes
World War I and the Russian Revolution of 1917 were consequences of the develop-
ments and chain of events in the second half of the nineteenth and the beginning of
the twentieth century. Both were very significant experiences involving millions of
people: they influenced and shaped the entire 20th century.
OBJECTIVES
After studying the lesson, you will be able to:
• identify some of the factors which caused the war in 1914, and discuss whether
such factors of conflict exist in the world today;
• explain why the revolution became possible in the Russian Empire of 1917 and
not in any other country;
• analyse the immediate and long term consequences of both the War and the
Russian Revolution and
• discuss the meaning of the War and the Revolution for India.
23.1 HOW W AS WORLD WAR I DIFFERENT FROM PREVIOUS
WARS IN HISTORY
Except for Spain, the Netherlands, the three Scandinavian countries and Switzerland,
all the European nations were involved in a war which connected the whole world in
its violence and suffering. Troops from other areas-specifically colonies- were also
made to fight in this war for countries which ruled over them. For example, Indian
soldiers had to fight for Britain outside the territory of India. It is estimated that over
three million men came from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and
India on the side of Britain (Britain ruled over these areas). The regions involved i. e.,
the territories of the war zones were also widespread: the war engulfed Europe, Asia,
Africa and the Pacific. For the first time almost the entire peoples of the world were
involved in a war, which they also knew was a world war.
There were new technologies used in warfare, not seen in earlier wars: airplanes,
tanks and submarines. But it was fought on the ground in the ordinary way as well
and most people remembered it that way later because most images of war depicted
soldiers fighting in trenches on ground. Sea battles took place in the South Atlantic"

Notes

and the Pacific. USA for the first time got involved on a world scale, with more than
100,000 troops on the side of Britain and her allies.
The World War led to huge mobilizations of men as soldiers, while women took on
many jobs back in the cities and also as nurses in the battle zones. Governments took
many measures to ensure that their own armies do not run short of any supplies. Just
as they mobilized men they also mobilized grain for food from peasants. They cur-
tailed workers’ rights to make them work longer hours and for same wages to meet
the needs of army equipment and ammunition. There was a rise in prices of food and
articles of daily consumption because major investments were only in industries re-
lated to war and other requirements of war. There was a general sense of despair
among people.
We must also remember that there were 10 million who were killed in war or due to
hardships caused by war, another 20 million who were wounded, and millions who
became refugees or unemployed as towns and industries were destroyed.
Homelessness resulted not just on border areas of countries, but all over. Civilian
populations were involved and became casualties for the first time in war history:
bombings of civilian areas, and the famines and epidemics caused by war, led to
millions of civilian deaths.
When it began most people thought the war would be short: it lasted four years. You
can imagine what life would have been like for people in countries involved in a war
for four whole years. It dismantled quite a few of the existing socio-economic and
political structures. It affected the economy of the entire world. Because of the
spread and the mobilization of all resources by the warring states on such scale for
the first time, it is known as the First World War.
For all these reasons the war marked a turning point in world history.
23.2 REASONS FOR WAR
The reasons for World War I are complex, although it was sparked off by a kind of
incident which could have happened anywhere at any time. There was hostility be-
tween Serbia and Austria during which Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand, heir to throne of
Habsburg Empire was murdered at Sarajevo in 1914. This became the event which
spiraled into World War I.
But why did one incident have such devastating consequences as to finally lead the
entire world into a four year war?
You have already read about the race for colonies in an earlier lesson, and how in the
second half of the nineteenth century there was a full fledged imperialist system in
place. For example, in 1876 no more than 10 percent of Africa was under European
rule, but by 1900 more than 90 percent was colonized. You have also seen that
Germany had been left behind in this race, and now it began to feel that she too
wanted her own colonies to rule over. By 1914 these powers were ready to increase
their own respective spheres of influence, to bring more areas under each one’s
control, and to have a larger share in the resources of the world.
As most of the world was already divided amongst them, each one could increase its
own areas of control, economically or politically, only by ‘reordering’ the world, or
fighting each other to increase their own share at the expense of another. Though none
of them thought in terms of a big war, yet potential for conflict was always there."

HISTORY
 World War I and the Russian Revolution
They made short wars for gaining new territories from another country or to protect
territories already under their control, and sometimes in order to check a rival they
entered into alliance with another power. Bismarck of Germany entered into an alli-
ance with Austria-Hungary in 1879, known as Dual Alliance, which became the Triple
Alliance when Italy joined in 1882. On the other side France in 1894 made an alliance
with Russia, in 1904 France made an agreement with Britain and in 1907 Britain
made an entente with Russia. This came to known as Triple Entente.
The leaders of Europe thought these alliances would prevent war through a balance
of power: in fact what happened was that these alliances tied the countries together.
When one country went to war the others would have to get involved to help their
ally. The rivalries and conflicts among the imperialist countries thus became the un-
derlying causes of the War.
Nationalist movements were an important feature of the nineteenth century. By the
late nineteenth and early twentieth century nationalism also underwent a transforma-
tion. In the advanced capitalist countries it became linked with extending areas of
control and increasing one’s military strength. The dominating perception was no
longer one that came with the French revolution and its ideals of ‘Liberty, Equality,
and Fraternity’. These countries were also no longer concerned with the idea of
popular sovereignty in a nation. On the other hand within multi national empires like
Austria-Hungary and the Russian Empire people wanted to free themselves and
form independent nations, which all big powers were opposed to.
The big powers therefore went in for an unprecedented arms race, and building up of
huge armies and navies. Militarism became the main aspect of foreign policy. Do-
mestic policies were aimed at increasing strength vis a vis other powers rather than
the welfare of their own citizens. Mass media was made into a major tool: newspa-
pers played an important role in the spread of aggressive nationalism.
In 1901 relatively few people were permitted to vote anywhere, and women practi-
cally nowhere. Most citizens therefore hardly had an influence on policy making of
their governments.  The governments were guided by the interests of capitalists and
landlords and under their influence they competed among themselves for increasing
areas of control under them. Although ordinary people hardly had a stake in this
competition, once the war broke out people did come forward with support for their
respective countries.
The horrors of modern war were still not understood. It was the impact of war that
made people reconsider the war and begin to demand peace.
23.3 COURSE OF WAR
We will not go into the details of the course of war or the major campaigns.  But you
should know that Austria regarded the murder in Serbia as provocation for war, and once
she decided to retaliate, her Triple Alliance partners Germany and Italy were drawn in on
her side, and the other powers (Britain, France and Russia) came on the opposing side.
Germany sent troops towards France and seemed to be succeeding, when Russia
attacked Germany and Austria from the east. The war became long drawn and more
complicated. Fighting in the trenches on the ground continued for four years as both
sides were evenly matched. Labour from colonies was used for digging trenches.
Then the war spread to areas in Asia and Africa."

 World War I and the Russian Revolution
Use of technology during the war meant heavy casualties for all countries. For
example, on the first day of the Battle of the Somme, 60, 000 British soldiers were
killed or wounded.
Italy changed sides during the course of the war. In April 1917 the US also declared
war on Germany. The decisive element at this stage was the revolutionary movement
in the Russian Empire.
In October 1917 the Russian revolution was successful and Russia came out of the
war when communists emerged in leadership there. They signed a peace treaty with
Germany in March 1918. This treaty was very harsh on Russia, but the new regime
in Russia, led by Lenin, agreed to it because they had been opposed to the war from
the beginning.
This complicated matters: not only to Germany, but also to Britain and France, the
new Russia seemed a bigger enemy because they were fundamentally opposed to
communism.
Therefore when the fortunes of battle began to turn by the beginning of 1918 and the
German armies began to retreat, Britain and France agreed to a peace. In Germany
too, as in Russia, the workers threatened revolution. Armistice came into effect on
November 11, 1918, and then all the powers together put their strength into trying to
defeat the revolution in Russia. You will learn something about it in the next section.

23.4 THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION, 1917
The Russian Revolution was made in 1917, before the end of the War. It is also
known as the Bolshevik revolution, because Bolsheviks as a political group played a
leading role in the success of the revolution and also determined its policies.
This was the first socialist revolution in history and it was inspired by the ideals of
communism. In your earlier lessons you have learnt something about capitalism and
the ideas of socialism, and how socialism represents equality and social justice to a
greater degree than is possible under capitalism. The revolution came about as a
result of the movements of the working people—the working class and the peasantry.
By 1917 the Russian Empire was under strain both from the consequences of the
long war and by the political and social movements within the country. Up to Febru-
ary 1917 Russia was a multinational Empire, ruled by an autocrat, who was known as"

HISTORY
 World War I and the Russian Revolution
the Tsar. Its territory was huge, including a large part of Central Asia and parts of
Eastern Europe. There were no representative institutions, no right to form political or
trade union organizations, no elections. There was strict censorship and arbitrary
arrests. There was no religious tolerance, and the other nationalities and minorities in
the Empire did not enjoy equal rights with the Russians, because the Tsar, Nicholas II,
belonged to the Russian Romanov dynasty. The Tsar used his military and diplomatic
strength against all democratic movements in Europe. For this he was known as the
‘Policeman’ of Europe. These conditions were very oppressive and very different
from Western Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century.
23.5 THE OLD AND THE NEW
While the political system remained an autocracy, important changes were taking
place in economy and society, which created new aspirations. New ideas were also
emerging, and many sections of society were becoming dissatisfied with the oppres-
sive rule of the Tsar. Since they had no parliamentary system or elections through
which to express their opposition to the Tsarist policies, they had to adopt a revolu-
tionary path.  They had to overthrow the system of autocracy itself to have a say in
society and policies which affected them. This was a major difference between other
European countries and the Russian Empire.
23.6 AGRICULTURE AND PEASANT DISCONTENT
The peasants were also very discontented. As in western and central Europe, the
peasant-serfs were freed in the Russian Empire as well, although very much later, in
1861. But despite this land reform, the landed aristocracy remained strong and con-
tinued to oppress the peasants. Also, the peasantry just did not have enough land: the
peasants constituted about 80 percent of the population, but had hardly 50 percent of
the land. The demand for land was therefore a major cause for anger against the Tsar
who had let them down by such an inadequate land reform.
Also the freed peasants had to pay very heavily for both land and freedom, because
the Tsar was interested in keeping the goodwill and support of the big landlords by
giving more than fair compensation to them. The peasants had to pay such a heavy
price that they remained continually in debt, and were forced to work very cheaply
for the landlords. Peasants were also very heavily burdened with taxes.
Agriculture remained backward because the peasants did not have enough money to
invest in the improvement of their land, and the landlords thought: why pay for buying
machinery if peasants are there as cheap labour?
In all matters of interest to the peasants the autocracy sided with the landlords,  and
sent out troops to suppress peasant revolts. Since agriculture was the major sector of
Russian economy and peasants were the majority population, the agricultural back-
wardness and the peasant discontent became important factors for the revolution.
There were continuous peasant uprisings during the 19th century, and in the early 20th
century they became part of the general revolutionary movement.
23.7 INDUSTRIALISATION AND WORKERS’ DISCONTENT
The workers movement in the Russian Empire was stronger and more political than
anywhere else in Europe. This had something to do with the nature of industrialization
here and the political conditions in the Russian Empire. Industrialization in Russia was"

Notes
 World War I and the Russian Revolution
late as compared to Western Europe, but it was at a much faster pace. This meant
that there were small, but also many huge factories with a great number of workers,
even in the early stages of industrialization. Working class movements were there-
fore able to develop here much faster than they had in the west European countries,
and the capitalists here did not get time to consolidate their power before the working
class movement became strong. Many strikes took place in the last decade of the
nineteenth century, and by 1905 the workers played a leading role in the revolutionary
movement.
The workers’ movement in the Russian Empire was also much more militant and
political than in other countries; and it was both against the Autocracy which did not
allow them to form organizations and sided with their employers, and against the
employers who were the factory owners and responsible for their low wages and bad
working conditions. Their movement also had a greater orientation towards socialism
than in other countries.
By the first decade of the 20th century women constituted a sizeable percentage of
the working class and also working class organizations, as a result of which many
issues pertaining to them began to be reflected in the discussions on workers’ rights
and women’s equality. Working class women participated in a big way in working
class movements.
23.8 DISCONTENT AMONG NATIONALITIES
The relationship between the Russian Romanov dynasty and the other nationality
regions was almost colonial in nature, with these areas being used as sources of raw
material for development of industries in Russian regions. You may remember that
something like that happened to India as well under British colonial rule. These na-
tionalities such as the Caucasians, the Polish, the Kazakhs, the Latvians, the Esto-
nians and others played an important role in overthrowing the Russian autocracy.
23.9 LEADERSHIP AND VISION
For a revolutionary movement to succeed it is necessary that there should be a com-
mitted leadership, it should be guided by certain ideals and should have a programme
of change. In other words, people should not merely like to destroy something; they
should also have an idea of what they want to build, and of how to go about bringing
change. They should be able to form organizations to take forward their movements.
Many political groups were active during the first half of the 20 th century, but they
were illegal and had to work underground, hunted by the Tsarist police and subject to
severe repression and punishment if found out. However, they played a very heroic
and significant role in raising the consciousness of the people-particularly of the workers
and peasants-through political education, political propaganda and agitation. Millions
of organizations were formed on the ground among all sections of society-of workers,
peasants and soldiers, of students and teachers, of all types of employees, and of
women. Many of these organizations had close links with political parties and were
very responsive to political discussions and ideas.
By 1917 women’s organizations began to reflect working women’s interests as well,
as did working class organizations, although women had to fight continuously for such
attention. Although women constituted a big share in popular movements, there were
still very few women in leadership roles."

HISTORY
 World War I and the Russian Revolution
The important political groups were Populists (in late 19th century) and Social Revo-
lutionaries, various types of Liberals and the Social Democrats (Marxists). Social
Democrats had two parties, Bolshevik (meaning majority in Russian) and Menshevik
(meaning minority). They got these names after they split as a result of differences.
These groups had different ideas about how to bring about a revolution, of how to
change the Russian society and political system.
Lenin was the most important leader of the Russian revolution of 1917. Another was
Trotsky. Both were Bolsheviks. It would be correct to say however that there were
thousands of important leaders, both men and women, just as there were in our free-
dom movement, without whose work, heroism and sacrifices the revolution could not
have succeeded.
23.10 STAGES OF THE REVOLUTION
The Russian revolutionary movement emerged in the 19th century, when some members
of the aristocracy began to feel that the Tsarist political system was too oppressive
and Russian society too unjust. They particularly felt for the plight of the peasantry.
How could Russia progress if the majority of its people were in such a sorry condi-
tion? These members of the aristocracy and the newly emerged middle class formed
the intelligentsia, who criticized Russian society and political system and worked for
its transformation. They formed secret societies and small political groups. They could
not campaign or work openly to spread their ideas because of the strict censorship
and ban on political activity. They became dedicated revolutionaries. They demanded
a constitution and elections. Many women were active revolutionaries. When caught
they were given cruel punishments. Yet the movement grew.
As workers and peasants became confident of fighting the injustices of their lives,
they also began to struggle against the Autocracy. When they came into contact with
revolutionaries both the movements were enriched. By early 20th century the Russian
revolutionary movement was a mass based movement, and ‘Revolution’ became the
rallying cry.
The first major popular attack on the Autocracy, took place in 1905. This great revo-
lutionary upsurge was unsuccessful, and the movements were suppressed. But
because the people learnt many important lessons through this experience, Lenin later
called it the “dress rehearsal’ for the 1917 revolution. The main demands were a
“democratic republic’, universal franchise, land for peasantry, and higher wages and
a shorter working day for workers. Women’s equality, right of self determination for
the different nationalities and abolition of capital punishment were other demands.
For the first time there was a General Strike. Sections of the army and navy also
revolted, and a revolutionary organization of the working class known as Soviet was
formed. It played a leading role in the revolution.
Many years of repression followed, but the revolutionary movement picked up again
during World War I as larger and larger sections of people began to directly feel the
impact of war and to understand the nature of tsarist policies. The puppet Cabinet did
not function and the weak parliament (Duma) could not address popular aspirations.
By 1917 majority of the people of the Russian empire were determined to overthrow
the Autocracy and to take matters in their own hands. In this atmosphere the Febru-
ary revolution was sparked off by shortages of bread, and a demonstration of women
who called on the soldiers to support their brothers and sisters rather than the Tsar"

who oppressed them. The soldiers who were also fed up with the war did not fire on
the agitating people.
A few days later came the demand: ‘Down with Autocracy’. Red flags dominated
the cityscape of St Petersburg, the capital city, and soon the entire territory of the
Empire was aflame with cries of revolution. The Autocracy was overthrown and
replaced by a Provisional Government. The workers and peasants played an impor-
tant role in this change, and the bourgeoisie supported it. Even the soldiers came to
the side of the revolutionary forces. St.Petersburg was renamed Petrograd.
The Provisional government created conditions for political freedoms, such as right of
forming organizations and freedom of speech, but did not bring any major change in
policies which affected people; it could not have, as this government was dominated
by parties representing landlord and capitalist interests. The workers, soldiers and
peasants, along with the Bolshevik party, therefore continued with their movements
which culminated in the October-Bolshevik revolution of 1917.
The Bolsheviks were the only political group in tune with the aspirations of the people
in 1917: they called for an immediate end to War; they demanded land for peasants,
workers’ control over industries, and right of nations to self determination. Peace!
Bread! Land! Democracy! became the slogans in all the mass organizations of the
workers, peasants and soldiers all over the country, and Bolsheviks were elected to
their leaderships in a majority in these organizations.
The October 1917 revolution thus had a popular base and was not simply a military
coup that overthrew the Provisional Government. You should also remember that
although it is known as October revolution, it took place on November 7 1917, and is
celebrated on November 7, because after the revolution Russia adopted the interna-
tional calendar. Prior to that Russia was following it is own calendar which was 10
days behind the calendar followed internationally.
23.11 POLICIES AND IMPACT OF THE REVOLUTION
Revolutionary Russia not only changed the policies of Tsarist Russia, it also did many
things that were different and more just than what existed in capitalist countries of
Europe. Its policies laid the foundations of socialism in Russia.
Knowing fully well that people were tired of war and wanted peace, and that war
was not in the interest of people in any country, one of its first acts was to withdraw
from the war.
The Bolsheviks abolished private property in the means of production i.e., land, facto-
ries, and banks, all of which were nationalized and now owned by the state and not by
private owners. This means that they could not be used to exploit the labour of others
and make private profit anymore. Workers organizations had a greater say in the
decision making processes.
Through the land decree of November 1917 landlordism was abolished and land was
given over to peasants for hereditary use. Peasants could not sell or mortgage the
land or use it to exploit the labour of others, but they were masters of their land and
enjoyed the full fruits of their labour and produce from the land. They did not have to
depend on former landlords in any way, whose powers over rural economy and
society were demolished."

HISTORY
 World War I and the Russian Revolution
These measures meant that the Russian people became equal beneficiaries of the re-
sources and economy of the country. It also became possible now to plan centrally for
the benefit of all parts and all sections of the people. This system of centralized planning
was seen as important and was adopted by many countries, including India.
The new constitution guaranteed free medical care, free and equal education for all,
an unemployment allowance, equal access to culture and cultural advancement. Not
all of this was immediately available, but by making these a right for all, the new
regime showed the direction of its policy and commitment. The differentials between
people holding middle class type of jobs and those working on land or in the factories
were far less than in other countries-both in terms of salaries and entitlement to
facilities provided by the state. Standard of life was not dependent on whether one
could personally pay, because many things did not have to be paid for.
Women were not just considered equal; a lot of measures were taken to make their
equal participation in social and political life possible: maternity leave, public canteens,
free crèches at workplaces etc.
They considered their state the ‘dictatorship of the working class’ because the work-
ing, ordinary people and their welfare was now the basis of polity and policies.
The new regime gave moral and some physical support to independence struggles
against colonial rule, and recognized the right of all nationalities to decide their own
future. For this reason the Russian revolution was lauded in all Asian countries and
inspired people all over the world. China and India were also greatly influenced by the
Russian revolution. There was spread of socialist ideas.
Nationalist leaders in India realized the significance of the intervention of peasants
and workers in political struggles. People in India sensed that a ‘kisan-mazdoor raj’
has been established in Russia. The 1920’s thus saw the formation of Workers and
Peasants Parties, the All India Trade Union Congress, and increasing efforts in India
to organize workers and peasants.
The imperialist countries were however opposed to the Revolution and they sent their
troops to defeat the new Bolshevik regime. They were not successful, and the new
revolutionary regime  survived, due mainly to the support of the people and the dedi-
cation of the revolutionaries. What happened in Russia and Europe following the
Russian revolution and the end of World War I is another story, which you will read
about in the next lesson.

 World War I and the Russian Revolution
WHAT YOU HA VE LEARNT
World War I was very different from the previous wars in history because it con-
nected the whole would in its violence and suffering. There were new technologies
used in warfare, not seen earlier, and it had an impact on all aspects of life.
The reasons for the war were immediate as well as long term. The major reasons
were the race for colonies, control over the resources of the world. The war contin-
ued from 1914 to 1918 and ended with the defeat of Germany and her allies. The
Russian Revolution was achieved in 1917, before it ended.
The Russian Revolution came about as a result of the strain of war and the conflicts
within Russian society. This was the first socialist revolution in history.
There were three stages: the 1905 revolution, which was defeated; the February
1917 revolution which resulted in the overthrow of the Autocracy; and the October
1917 revolution led by the Bolsheviks, which established a socialist state.
The revolution created a new social and political system, based on social justice. It
had a great impact on the rest of the world, including the countries fighting for their
national independence.

GLOSSARY
Autocracy - A political system ruled by a king who holds all power and in
which there are no effective representative institutions that
can share political power.
Social democrats - Those who believed that it is not enough to have political and
legal equality alone, but also to have economic and social
equality. Therefore they believed in socialism.
Capitalism - A system based on rights of private property and market,
and therefore also private profit, in which the owner of prop-
erty derives his/her profit from the exploitation of labour of
those who work on it.
Socialism - A system based on state ownership of means of production,
so that the labour of those who work on it cannot be ex-
ploited for the private benefit of a few, and in which the
political system is such in which the interests of the working
people predominate."

THE INTER-WAR PERIOD AND THE
SECOND WORLD WAR
24
Notes
The first half of the twentieth century is known in history as the era of world wars.
The First World War was considered by many to be ‘a war to end all wars’. Yet, the
developments during the next twenty years, led the world into another war-more
destructive, more widespread and much larger in scale. In order to understand the
reasons for the outbreak of this war, we need to study the inter-war period in detail.
The end of the First World War did not end the rivalries between the European nation.
Even the peace Treaties failed to ensure peace. The treaties were harsh on the
defeated countries and thus sowed the seeds of future conflicts. They even failed to
satisfy the territorial ambitions of some of the allied powers. In many of the countries
strong dictators rose to power and spread the message of national chauvinism. The
most important fact was that, imperialism, the basic cause of war, was not destroyed.
The Russian Revolution and the emergence of the Soviet Union also divided the
world into two groups-those who favored the revolution and those who fear
effects. Most of the west European countries belonged to the latter group. They
considered socialism to be a threat to their social and economic systems. Soviet
Russia was also anti-imperialist and supported the freedom struggles in the colo-
nies of Asia and Africa. This chapter will tell you how all these combined to
create conditions for another war.
OBJECTIVES
After studying the lesson, you will be able to:
 analyze the peace treaties and the changed map of Europe;
 trace the rise of totalitarian regimes – Italy, Germany and Japan;
 explain effects of Great Depression on U.S.A., U.S.S.R and Europe ;
 correlate aggression and appeasement and
 explain the course of war."

HISTORY
 THE INTER-WAR PERIOD AND THE SECOND WORLD WAR
24.1 THE PEACE TREATIES
The First World War ended with the signing of the peace treaties at a conference held
in Paris. The important leaders at the conference were the U.S. President Woodrow
Wilson, the British Prime Minister Lloyd George, and the French Prime Minister
George Clemenceau.
League of nations:
One of the first acts of the peace conference was the decision to create a world
organization, called the League of Nations, for the promotion of ‘international coop-
eration, peace and security. The Covenant (formal agreement) of the League was
approved in April 1919.
The agreement required all member to reduce armaments in the interest of peace. If any
member country resorted to war, then collective action would be taken against that coun-
try. The trade relations with the aggressor country would also be cut off. However, the
League of Nations could never be an effective organization. Two major countries-Soviet
Union and Germany - were not allowed to become its members for many years. United
States, despite its leading role in the formation of the League, decided not to join it. Hence,
when aggression began in the 1930s, the League failed to prevent it.
The Treaty of Versailles:
The peace treaties were to be based on President Wilson’s peace proposals or Four-
teen Points, which promised to bring in an era of peace, freedom, democracy, self-
determination (the right to have a say in one’s own government). But these principles
were ignored when the allies signed the Treaty of Versailles with Germany.
According to the treaty:
1. Germany was blamed as the aggressor and forced to accept responsibility
for the damage caused to the Allies during war.
2. Germany was to pay $6,600 million as compensation to them.
3. The German coal mining area in Saar valley was put under the control of the
league for 15 years, while the mines were transferred to France for that period.
4. The newly created state of Poland (see Map.1) was provided a corridor
which give her an outlet to the Baltic Sea. This corridor separated East
Prussia from the rest of Germany. The port of Danzig, which lay in the
corridor, was made a free city.
5. The strength of the German army was to be limited to 100,000 and it was
permitted to have any air force or navy.
6. Germany’s colonial possessions were divided amongst the victorious pow-
ers. We shall read more about the territories lost by Germany after a study of
the map of Europe.
Germany was  made to sign this treaty under threat of invasion. In fact no German
representative was invited to attend the conference. So the Germans called it a “dic-
tated peace”.
Some of the seeds of the Second World Was were thus sown at Versailles."

 THE INTER-WAR PERIOD AND THE SECOND WORLD WAR
24.2 THE CHANGED MAP OF EUROPE 2 BLOCK
A study of the cost-war map of Europe shows us that almost all European coun-
tries emerge from war with changed frontiers. Germany surrendered Alsace
Lorraine to France, which it had captured in 1871. In the north it gave up some
areas to Belgium and Denmark. The area given to Poland has already been men-
tioned. Apart from losses in Europe, Germany also gave up right on its African
colonies and privileges in China. Thus, after war, the Germans were a discon-
tented lot.
Italy has fought the war on the Allied side to satisfy her territorial ambitions in Aus-
tria, Turkish Empire and Africa. But all that Italy gained from the peace settlement
was a small part of Austria.
Russia suffered more casualties in war than all the Allies put together. It withdrew
from war in March 1918 after signing a treaty with Germany. By this treaty it ac-
cepted the independence of  Poland, Finland and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia
and Lithuania. Added to this were the proplems of civil war, military intervention and
economic collapse.
Poland, which had disappeared from the map in 1815, after being annexed by the
three empires of Austria, Prussia and Russia, now reappeared when the three em-
pires declined together. However, the old enmity with the new neighboring countries
could not be wiped out so easily.
By a separate treaty, Austria was reduced to a small state and it lost all its imperial
glory. Austria recognized the independence of the newly formed countries of Hun-
gary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. You would remember that Italy had
also gained some territory at the cost of Austria. All the newly formed countries had
to deal with the problems of border disputed, political upheavals and economic diffi-
culties.
Britain was given Palestime and Iraq as MANDA TES and France was given
Syria. They would administer them till the people learnt to govern themselves. But
these Mandates were also governed as colonies.
The treaty with Turkey resulted in the complete dismemberment of the Turkish Em-
pire. Turkey lost its Arab possessions in North Africa, in Southwest Asia and almost
all its territories in Europe. Some of these territories came under British and French
control as mandates. Russia and Greece also gained some areas. Turkey was thus
reduced to a small state. The Turks rose in rebellion against the treaty under the
leadership of Mustafa Komal. The Sultan was removed from power and a republic
was established in Turkey in 1923 with Mustafa Kemal as its first president. He
began the process of modernization of the country. The people called him ‘ATATURK’
or Father of the Turks.
You have just read about the changes that occurred in various European countries.
An understanding of these changes tells us that most countries remained dissatisfied
with the peace treaties. Was another re-division of the world necessary? Was an-
other war the only solution?
This chapter will help you find the answers."

24.2 RISE OF TOTALITARIAN REGIMES
The immediate post war years were full of problems for almost all countries of Eu-
rope. These included reorganization of the economy, resettlement of the survivors of
war, and growing unemployment. The working classes in many countries tried to
organize socialist revolutions on the Soviet pattern, but they were ruthlessly suppressed.
In their place, strong, anti-democratic movements arose in Hungary, Poland, Italy,
Portugal, Germany and Spain, which can generally be termed as ‘Fascist’.
Emergence of Fascism in Italy:
The term ‘Fascism’ is of Italian origin and was first used for the movement started
by Beni to Mussolini in Italy. The fascists adopted as their symbol ‘the fasces’ or a
bundle of rods, which represented state power. The main features of these move-
ments were opposition to democracy and socialism, establshiment of dictatorial rule,
extreme nationalsm and militarism.
Mussolini made eloquent speeches about the glory of ancient Roman Empire and
urged people to restore Italy’s honor. Many ex-soldiers, after listening to his speeches,
joined his armed gangs, which was a private army called ‘Blackshirts’.  Mussolini
used these gangs to break up strikes and to spread terror among the socialists and
communists. The ruling classes of Italy did not curb their action because they also
wanted to prevent a socialist revolution.
In 1921, Mussolini set up the National Fascist Party. In  October next year, he sent
30,000 of his Blackshirts in a march on Rome. The government surrendered without
a fight and the king asked Mussolini to form the new government. By 1928, Mussolini
had destroyed all parliamentary opposition and had begun to rule as  a dictator. All
non-fasicst parties were banned. He used imprisonment corture and organized kill-
ings to suppress the socialists and the communists. He set up the Fascist Grand"

Council and took the title of II Duce of The Leader. He tried to make Italy a great
power by advocating a policy of war and expansion.
Hitler and Nazi Germany:
You already know about the humiliating defeat of Germany and the downfall of its
monarchy. In 1919, a Republician form of government was established under a new
constitution, which provided for a President, a Chancellor and an elected Parliament.
During the world war, Adolf Hitler had been a soldier in the German army and had
fought bravely for four years, winning an Iron Cross. Disappointed at Germany’s
defeat, he now decided to join poltics. In 1921, Hitler’s powerful speeches and his
organizational skills made him the leader of the National socialist German Workers’
Party, in short, the Nazi party. Like Fascists, it had its own army called the ‘Storm Troop-
ers’ or the ‘Brownshirts.’ By 1930, the Brown shirts number about 100,000 men.
After the Fascist  captured power in Italy, Corporal Adolf Hitler made a similar
attempt in Germany in 1923. The attempt failed and Hitler was jailed. While in jail
Hitler wrote his book Mein Kampf (My struggle), in which he set out his plans to
create the most barbaric dictatorship of modern times.
The 1936 Olympics were held in Berlin. Hitler wanted to use the games to prove
his theory of Aryan racial superiority. But his attempt failed as the most popular
hero of the games was an Afro-American sprinter –Jesse Owems.
The aim of Nazi policies was to wipe out the humiliation of Versailles and to make
Germany powerful and feared in the world.
The Nazis were similar to Fascism in their opposition to democracy, civil liberties and
socialism. They used brutal force to crush any opposition.
Hitler put the blame for Germany’s defeat in war on the Jews, so extermination of the
Jewish race became an important feature of Nazism. He believed in the purity and
superiority of the German race-calling them pure blood Aryans-and wanted the union
of all Germans to create a Greater Germany. A very large section of the people were
marked by the Nazi politcs. They appealed to the national pride of Germans and
gained support for Nazi politics.
The economic development of the 1930s helped in Hitler’s rise to power. A severe
depression hit America and Europe. As a result almost 8 million workers in Germany
became unemployed. The Nazi party now began to spread its influence. The Com-
munists and the Socialists failed to unite against the Nazis. Consequently, the Nazi
party, which had won only 12 seats in the Parliament in 1928, became the single
Largest party in 1932. President Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor and asked
him to form the new government.
Soon after coming to power, Hitler unleashed a reign of terror. All democratic prin-
ciples were put aside. In February 1933, the Nazis set the Parliament building on fire
and put the blame on the socialists and communists. Over 60,000 people were impris-
oned or sent to concentration camps. By mid-1933 all political parties, other than the
Nazi party, were banned. Following Hindenburg’s death on August 2 1934, Hitler
became the President of Germany. An organized campaign for the total"

extermination of Jews was launched. Simultaneously a programme of militarization
was introduced. The victory of Nazism brought the world closer to war.
Hitler was so ruthless that he ordered the killings of hundreds of storm Troopers,
who had helped in his rise to power, in one night. June 30 1934 is known as the
night of Long Knives.
Military Fascism in Japan:
Japan had been the only country in Asia to escape colonization. By the end of the
nineteenth century, Japan’s expansionist policy led her to a war with China. The
defeat of China enabled Japan to gain a foothold in the country. In 1905, Japan de-
feated Russia in war and took over Manchuria, the Russian sphere of influence in
China. This was the first instance of an Asian country defeating a mighty European
nation in war. Later Japan also annexed Korea.
The outbreak of the First World War gave her a chance to acquire Germany’s pos-
sessions in China and some German-held islands in the Pacific. After the war the
League gave her the mandate over the islands. By this time, Japan’s military had
become a dominating force in society. It destroyed democracy within the country and
advocate of extreme nationalism and expansionism. In less than fifty years Japan
changed from a peaceful country to an aggressive military power. During one 1930s
she was to establish close relations with the fascist governments of Germany and
Italy for another re-division of the world.

24.3 THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND ITS EFFECTS
A significant development after the First World War was the decline in the supremacy
of Europe and the growing importance of the United States of America. While the
war damaged the economy of the European countries, the U.S. economy became
stronger. No war was fought on the U.S. soil and the industrial expansion also contin-
ued during war as it supplied arms and other materials to the Allies. However, a
decade later serious economic problems arose in the country, which later spread to
the rest of Europe.
You know that America followed the capitalist system of production, in which maxi-
mum profit was made by the owners of industry. Most of the workers, however, lived
below the poverty line. Thus, not many people had the means to buy goods, which
were being produced by the industries. So ‘overproduction’ and ‘maldistribution of
purchasing power’ were the two main causes of The Great Depression, which hit
U.S.A. in Oct. 1929 and then spread worldwide.
The Crisis began with a fall in the share prices leading to a collapse of the U.S. stock
market. In one day, nearly 16 million shares were sold on the New York stock exchange.
During the next four years, almost 9000 banks closed operations and millions of people
lost their life’s savings.
As goods remained unsold, thousands of factories shut down, resulting in unemploy-
ment, poverty and starvation.
Most of the European countries, except Soviet Union, also suffered as they had
become dependent on the U.S. economy, especially on the American bank. The ef-
fects of the crisis in these countries were similar. The number of unemployed in the
world rose to over 50 million, of which 15 million were in U.S. alone
The economic crisis also affected the political conditions in these countries. In U.S.
the Democratic Party came to power with Franklin D. Roosevelt as President. He
introduced a programme of economic reform and social welfare called New Deal. In
Britain and France, labour friendly governments came to power. Though fascist move-
ments arose in Britain and France they were not successful.
In Germany and Italy as you have read above, post war discontent and Depression
led to victories of fascist parties.
During the 1930s the foreign polices of U.S, Britain and France were also similar.
They did not adopt a strong position against the fascists. Their main concern was to
check the spread of socialist ideas and workers’ movements. Thus when fascist
aggressetion began, they did nothing to check it. Instead they chose to appease Fas-
cism in the hope that it would destroy communism.
Developments in the USSR
We have already discussed Russia’s participation in war and the Russian Revolution.
This was followed by a civil war and the allied military intervention. All this had
resulted in the collapse of the Russian economy. There was a severe shortage of food
and the industrial production declined drastically."

HISTORY
 THE INTER-WAR PERIOD AND THE SECOND WORLD WAR
The consequent famine worsened the conditions further.
Lenin was forced to take strict measures. The soviet government forcibly seized
surplus food from rich farmers (kulaks), to feed the rest of the population. Nothing
could be bought or sold in the markets. The industrial produce was distributed to the
workers in lieu of wages. People were encouraged and even forced to work for the
good of their fellow men rather than for motive. This grim state of affairs, which
lasted from 1918–1921. was called ‘War Communism’.
The fierce opposition to this system mainly from the peasantry and some members of
his above party led Lenin to replace it by the New Economic Policy in 1921. The harsh
measures of War Communism were withdrawn. Now the peasant  gave one-tenth of
their produce as tax and were allowed to sell the rest in the open markets. Though  most
of the industries remained under state control, yet smaller industries were given back to
private owners. Payment of wages in cash was reintroduced.
A new constitution was introduced in 1924, under which Russia because the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republic. But after Lenin’s death in 1924 a fierce power struggle
arose within the party. There  were serious differences among the senior leaders
over the policies to be followed. Finally, Stalin, emerged victorious, became the Gen-
eral Secretary of the Communist Party, and soon assumed great powers.
Within a few years, the U.S.S.R. started a vigorous program of industrialization through
a series of Five Years Plans. The first plan was introduced in 1929. One of the aims
of the Plan was to bring about changes in agriculture. After the revolution, agricul-
tural land had been redistributed among peasants resulting in millions of small, less
productive land holdings. To increase production, the government promoted the idea
of Collectivization of small farms. The peasants were both encouraged and forced to
give up private ownership of farms, land was pooled and they had to become mem-
bers and joint owners of the collective farms. The kulaks, who opposed collectiviza-
tion, were severely dealt with. It is estimated that thousands perished during this
period.
The main effort of the plan was towards industrialization. Here the success was
greater and soon Soviet Russia emerged a major, industrial power in the world. It is
important to remember that the capitalist economies at this time faced a severe eco-
nomic crisis. The Soviet example of a successful socialist economy stood out and
was adopted later by many colonies after independence. Most of the European coun-
tries and U.S.A., however, did not recognize Soviet Russia till 1933. It became a
member of the League of Nations only in 1934. The hostility towards Soviet Union
continued even after this. When fascist aggression began in the 1930s, Soviet Union
was the only major power that actively opposed them.

24.4 AGGRESSION AND APPEASEMENT
The 1930s witnessed several acts of aggression by Italy, Germany and Japan. In this
section, we will see that most of the western powers not only remained mute specta-
tors to these acts but even supported some of them, thereby helping the fascists
prepare the stage for war.
Japanese invasion of Manchuria
The first major act of aggression was the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931.
Trouble began with an explosion on the Japanese railway line and Japanese military
officers used it as an excuse to take over Manchuria. China appealed to the League
of Nations but no action was taken. Japan quit the League of Nations and it launched
another attack on China in 1937.
Italy takes over Ethiopia
In 1935, Italy invaded Ethiopia and an appeal was made to the League. The League
condemned Italy as an aggressor and put a ban on the sale of arms to Italy. By 1936,
however, Italy completed the conquest of Ethiopia and the League, once again, failed
to resist aggression.
Expansion of Nazi Germany
In our study of Hitler’s rise to power, we saw that he became the Chancellor as well
as the President of Germany. He then started the process of re-militarization of Ger-
many in violation of the Treaty of Versailles.
The German troops entered Rhineland, which had been demilitarized by the treaty.
Moreover, the troops now numbered 800,000 as against the Treaty limit of 100,000.
The absence of any retaliatory action by France and Britain gave Hitler increased
confidence to build up an Air force and a Navy. The Saar valley was also reunited
with Germany. In 1936, Hitler and Mussolini signed the Rome-Berlin Axis, and in
1937, they signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan."

Hitler’s next Plan was the annexation of Austria. The union of Austria and Germany
or the Anschluss was completed in 1938. The same year, at a conference in Munich,
Britain and France signed the Munich Pact. By this pact, they agreed to the German
occupation of Sude tenland in Czechoslovakia. The Czechs had no role in these talks.
Germany wanted Sudetenland because this area had a large German population and
was the hub of coal chemical and iron and steel industries. A few months later, Ger-
many took over the whole of Czechoslovakia. The Munich Pact was the last act of
appeasement by the western powers.

 THE INTER-WAR PERIOD AND THE SECOND WORLD WAR
A dress rehearsal of Second World War
The first example of joint German-Italian aggression was seen during the Spanish
Civil War (1936–39). It had serious consequence for the entire world and is
consideredto be a dress rehearsal of the Second World War.
In 1936, a Popular Front Government, comprising the socialists, communists and other
anti fascist parties, came to power in Spain. They formed a democratic republic under
the leadership of General Franco, a section of the army planned to overthrow this
government. Germany and Italy gave armed support to Franco’s men and German
aircrafts carried out air raids on Spanish towns and villages. They captured many
parts of the country and terrorized people into submission.
The Republican government appealed for help but Britain, France and U.S.A.
accepted a policy of non-intervention. Only the Soviet Union offered to help the Re-
publicans. The anti-fascists from all over the world came together to form an Interna-
tional Brigade to fight for the Republic. Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru went to Spain to offer
the support of the Indian Freedom Movement to the Republic. The Spanish Civil War
was no longer a Spanish affair as thousands of non-Spaniards sacrificed their lives to
save the Republic from the fascists. The civil war continued for three years. By 1939,
Spain fell to the fascists and the new government was recognized by most of the
western powers.
Towards Poland
You can understand that the policy of appeasement adopted by the western powers
encouraged the fascist towards more aggression. The Soviets demanded an anti-
fascist alliance but the western powers did not agree. To protect its own interests the
USSR signed a Non-Aggression pact with Germany in August 1939.
Hitler now directed his attention towards Poland. He wanted both, the Danzig Free
City and the Polish Corridor, which, you remember, had separated East Prussia from
the rest of Germany. The British and French governments declared that they would
attack Germany if it invaded Poland. But Hitler could not be stopped now. On
September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland. Two days later, Britain and France
declared war on Germany. The Second World War had begun.

conquest of Poland in three weeks. Despite declaration of war, no help reached Poland.
The Soviet Red Army took the oppurtunity to get back the territories which had earlier
been part of the Russian empire. By 1940, the Russians had taken over the Baltic States-
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania-and forced a treaty on Finland. As there was little actual

 THE INTER-WAR PERIOD AND THE SECOND WORLD WAR
In praise of the role of R.A.F., Churchill said, ‘Never have so many owed so much
to so few’
On 9th April, 1940 the German forces launched an attack on Norway and Denmark and
conquered them. Next to fall were the neutral countries of Belgium, Holland and Lux-
emburg. This was followed by the invasion of France. The German armies occupied the
capital city of Paris, almost without a fight, on June 14, 1940. The French government
surrendered and Germany occupied the northern half of France. The other half re-
mained under the French and was called Vichy France. They collaborated with the
Nazis. The swift takeover of European countries by Hitler is called ‘lightning war’.
Meanwhile, about 350,000 British, French and Belgian troops, who did not surrender,
reached Dunkirk on the Northern coast of France, from where they marched  to
Britain. Among them was Charles , a colonel in the French army, who started the
‘Free France’ movement in Britain to fight Nazi Germany.
The battle for Britain
With the conquest of west Europe almost complete, Hitler turned his attention to
Britain. The invasion of Britain or ‘Operation Sea-Lion’ was only possible if the Ger-
man army could cross the English Channel. This meant that the Royal Air Force and
the Royal Navy had to be put out of action.
During the development discussed above, these was a change of government in Brit-
ain. The British Prime Minister Chamberlain, who had signed the Munich pact had
resigned and Winston Churchill took over as the new Prime Minister of a coalition
government.
In August 1940, the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) began its campaign over British
skies and carried out air raids on British ports and cities. The RAF in their Spitfires
and Hurricanes carried out air raids on British ports and cities. The Germans began
night raids on large cities, especially London. The aerial fights between the R.A.F
and Luftwaffe came to be known as ‘dogfights’. Churchill’s  powerful speeches kept
the morale of the people high and the British Air force caused sever damage to the
Luftwaffe.
By November 1940 Operation Sea-Lion was indefinitely put off
The expansion of war
On September 27 1940, Germany, Italy and Japan signed a Tripartie Pact at Berlin,
promising to give full support to each other in the event of an attack. The three Axis
powers also agreed upon the leadership of Germany and Italy in the establishment of
a new order in Europe and Japan’s similar leadership in Asia. Some other countries
like Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria also joined the pact.
Meanwhile, war had spread to other parts of Europe and Africa. Italy invaded Greece,
but faced stiff resistance. However, German troops succeeded in capturing Greece,
Yugoslavia and parts of North Africa. Italian and British forces clashed over several
territories in Africa and this conflict was to continue for another two years.
Germany turns against Soviet Union
A new chapter opened in the war with Hitler’s decision to invade Soviet Union. The
Non-Aggression pact was forgotten and ‘Operation Barbarossa’ was launched on"

HISTORY
 THE INTER-WAR PERIOD AND THE SECOND WORLD WAR
June 22 1941, without a formal declaration of war. The German army rapidly ad-
vanced on three fronts–Leningrad, Moscow and Kiev–and the  Soviet army taken by
Surprise, fell back. The soviet appeal for help had positive results at this times and
Britain and U.S.A. gave support.
Hitler had hoped to end the war before the onset of winter. By early October, Mos-
cow was besieged. But, by then, Russian Winters set in. Within a month, tempera-
tures dropped to–40 degrees C. Neither the German soldiers nor their equipment
could stand up to the extreme cold. By December, the Russian counter-attack started
and the German forces were driven back. The threat to Moscow was over. Opera-
tion Barbarossa had failed, but the Germans would accept total defeat only after
suffering another Russian winter, and a heroic resistance firm the Soviet Red Army.
A global war
Since the outbreak of war, U.S. had been sympathetic to Britain, allowing her to buy
arms, first on a ‘Cash and carry’ basis and then on a ‘Lend – lease’ system. The
latter deal was extended to the Soviet Union also in November 1941. However, U.S.
was opposed to direct entry into the war.
However, on December 7, 1941, Japan launched a surprise attack on the American naval
base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. This resulted in the destruction of the American Pacific
Fleet and the death of over 2000 soldiers. On December 8, US declared war on Japan
and, a few days later on Germany and Italy. The war had become truly global.
After Pearl Harbor, the Japanese advanced rapidly in the Far East, capturing Thai-
land, Malaya, Singapore, Hong Kong, Philippines and Burma, by the middle of 1942.
The fascist countries had reached the peak of their power.
The battle of Stalingrad
During the summer of 1942, Hitler’s army continued its offensive in the Soviet Union.
Hitler again hoped for victory but the advance of the German army was checked at
Stalingrad. By November, the German armies were in an around Stalingrad, but they
were encircled by the Soviet troops. All supplies to the German army cut off. The
Russian winter again took its toll and by January 31, 1943, the German army had
collapsed. Germany and their allies lost almost 250,000 men in the battle, which marked
the turning point in the war. Soviet Union also suffered very heavy losses in terms of
dead and wounded.
The beginning of the end
Meanwhile the war in North Africa had developed into a battle between the Western
Eighth Army under General Montgomery and the German Afrika Korps under Gen-
eral Rommel, who had been sent by Hitler to help the Italian troops. In August 1942,
Rommel began to move towards Egypt. The decisive battle was fought at E1 Alamein
on the north coast of Egypt in October 1943, which led to Rommel’s retreat.
By the summer of 1943, the Allies had taken over North Africa, In July, they invaded
Sicily. Mussolini’s government was overthrown and Italy surrendered uncondition-
ally. The German troops immediately marched into northern Italy and rescued Mussolini,
who set up his government under German protection.
On the Eastern front, the Soviet Red Army forced Hitler’s army to retreat along the
route on which they had set out so confidently two and a half years before."

 THE INTER-WAR PERIOD AND THE SECOND WORLD WAR
Most of the  East European countries–Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia,
and Hungary–were liberated. The fascists were also driven out of Greece, Yugosla-
via and Albania.
In June 1944, the Allies opened the Second Front in Western Europe. On
June 6–D- Day–the first of the Allied troops landed on the beaches of Normandy in the
North coast of France. The landings had been planned in total secrecy and they took the
Germans by surprise. Commanded by General Eisenhower, they broke through the
German line of defence an liberated Brussels, Paris and Luxemburg by September.
Surrender By the fascist powers
By the spring of 1945, the end of war was in sight. The allied troops had taken over
many cities in Italy. In April, there was an uprising in Fascist occupied areas. On
April 28, Mussolini was captured and executed, thus putting an end to fascism in Italy.
The downfall of Germany was now certain. The Allied troop entered Germany from
three directions – the south, the northwest and the east and as the Soviet army reached
Berlin, Hitler committed suicide. On May 7, Germany surrendered unconditionally.
The  fall of Japan
The war in Asia and the Pacific continued even after Germany’s surrender. Despite
American and British victories in the Pacific and the Far East, Japan still held out. On
August 6, 1945, U.S. dropped the first atom bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.
Fifty thousand people were killed and large parts of the city were leveled to the ground.
Two days later, a second bomb destroyed the city of Nagasaki and forced Japan to
surrender.
The Second world war came to an end. More than 50 countries had been involved in
war. Antother international organization – The United Nations Organizations – was
set up to mainting peace in the world. But the two super powers – U.S.A. and
U.S.S.R. – would soon try to divide the world into two power blocs, creating a situa-
tion of Cold War. That is what we will study in the next chapter.

THE COLD WAR ERA AND ITS
POLITICS
25
Notes
After the Second World War, the Allies of the war-the United States of America and
Soviet Russia-were engaged in what has been described as the ‘Cold War’. During the
War the two countries were on the same side with Britain and France to defeat the
Fascist dictatorships (Germany and Italy) and the empire of Japan. The two countries also
signed a five-year non-aggression treaty in 1941, and even as late as the Yalta Conference
in February 1945 there was some harmony among the two countries. But soon the situa-
tion changed completely and the USA and the Soviet Union stood against each other in a
“war like situation” which has generally been described as the Cold War.
OBJECTIVES
After studying the lesson, you will be able to:
 describe the meaning of the Cold War
 discuss the factors responsible for the Cold War
 point out different issues of struggle
 list the phases of the Cold War and
 compare the Cold War with New Cold War.
25.1 MEANING OF THE COLD WAR
The Cold War has been described as “peace time unarmed warfare” between new
superpowers. It was a “diplomatic war” and not an armed conflict among the super-
powers and was based on ideological hatred and political distrust. Flemming described
the Cold War as “a war that is fought not in the battlefield, but in the minds of men;
one tries to control the mind of others.” The Cold War was very different from an
open war where the enemies are well known and the war is fought in the open. In the
Cold War, war was never declared and diplomatic relations were maintained among
the countries. The Cold War did involve some military confrontation and loss of life,
but it was also a psychological warfare aimed at reducing the enemy’s area of influ-
ence and increasing the number of one’s camp followers.
The Cold War was a bi-polar confrontation between the United States of America
and the Soviet Union but it also involved allies or satellites of the two superpowers.
The Cold War has also been understood as the clash between two ideologies and two"

differently organised systems of economy and society-communism and liberal democ-
racy, and socialist command economy and capitalism. Although there have been many
bi-polar confrontations in history, this was the first time that two different forms of
social organisation were competing for implementing alternative visions of the world.
From the beginning of the 20 th century both the USA and the USSR were on their
way to becoming superpowers. A comparison of the share of various countries in
manufacturing in 1932, just after the Great Depression shows America the indisput-
able leader with nearly 32%, and the Soviet Union which came next with 11.5%. But
other leading countries were not far behind-Britain (10.9%), Germany (10.6%), France
(6.9%). After the Second World War, however, the armed strength of Germany and
Japan stood defeated and of Britain and France stood exhausted. Now it was the two
countries-America and Soviet Union-which emerged as superpowers. Soviet Union,
despite phenomenal losses in war made rapid strides because of its socialist com-
mand economy. The phenomenal rise of these two countries led to a competition
between the two which ultimately resulted in the Cold War.
The Soviet Union set up the Cominform (the Communist Information Bureau) , ‘Ra-
dio Moscow’ and supported some communist parties in other countries. The United
States of America set up a Radio News programme called ‘V oice of America’ and
supported the anti-communist political parties and movements in other countries.
The conflict between the two countries turned out to be the conflict between differ-
ent ideologies that both the countries adopted. One of these ideologies was political
and economic liberalism which was adopted by America and the other was Marxism-
Leninism adopted by Russia.

25.2 FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COLD WAR
After World War II, the USA and the USSR, the new superpowers, wanted to estab-
lish the supremacy of their position and ideology, and this conflict became the focal
point of international relations. There was formation of opposing blocs, intensifying
the rivalry of these two powers. Most western countries tended to side with the USA
and were firmly opposed to communism. America’s rise to the status of superpower
was complete with the possession of the nuclear weapons. Very soon Russia emerged
as a challenger and rival to America’s position and in 1949 she also developed nuclear
weapons and ended the American supremacy.
There had been a long period of suspicion and distrust between the Soviet Union and
the western countries. The Soviet Union could never forget that Western states"

(Britain, France and the USA) had tried to undo the Bolshevik revolution and inter-
vened (along with Japan) in the civil war. The western countries also did not forget
that the declared objective of the Soviet Union was the overthrowing of capitalism
worldwide. During World War II, mutual suspicion increased further. After Germany
invaded the USSR in 1941, the Western democracies delayed opening a second front
against Germany. Britain and the USA promised that they would do so, but the delay
confirmed the Soviet suspicion that the west wanted a prolonged struggle between
Germany and Russia so that both would be eliminated.
During the war, both the sides encouraged opposite elements in the countries liber-
ated from the Axis powers (Germany, Italy and a few smaller states). After the
fascist dictator Mussolini was removed from power in Italy, Italy was supported by
the Western powers and received ‘aid for reconstruction’ (grants of money totaling
hundreds of millions of USA dollars). Since Italy had one of the largest communist
parties outside of the USSR, USSR leaders saw this as an attempt to strengthen the
capitalist camp or bloc of countries. There were similar problems in Greece and
Poland. The USA helped defeat communist forces in Greece.
After 1945, both superpowers took some steps to lessen mutual suspicion. The USA
agreed to occupy only the western zones of Germany and Austria and to stay out of
Poland, Czechoslovakia and other eastern European territories that had been liberated by
the Soviet Red Army. The Soviet Union dissolved the Comintern (Communist Information
Bureau) and allowed capitalist forces to control Greece. The Soviet Union in 1952 va-
cated Finland and by 1955 had removed all its troops from Austria. There remained
differences of opinion between the USA and USSR regarding the future of Europe and
other areas. Soviet Union wanted to install ‘friendly’ governments in the East European
countries liberated from the Nazi Germany. By friendly governments, the Soviet Union
meant the communist governments, with which America and Britain did not agree. The
Soviet Union also tried to establish her domination in Turkey and delayed the withdrawal
of her troops from Iran, much to the dislike of the western countries.
Both sides were responsible for the Cold War. The temporary truce between the two
parties during the World War II was just a bright patch in the otherwise strained
relationship between the two, before and after the war.

 THE COLD WAR  ERA AND ITS POLITICS
the initial phase (1945-47) which has been called the ossification phase, the Cold War
began in earnest and at its centre was the creation of a European postwar order. The
onset of the Cold War reflected the failure of the different powers to consistently
respect the principles agreed on at wartime conferences of Yalta and Potsdam.
First Phase
In the early phase the fate of Poland turned out to be a crucial issue. All the countries
had a special interest in Poland. France and Britain had declared war on Germany
when Hitler’s army had crossed the Polish border in September 1939. For Russia,
Poland had been a historic enemy: on the other hand Polish lands had been the
traditional gateway for invasion of Russia from the west. When the Soviets entered
Poland in 1944, they formally handed over power to the Lublin government, pro-
communist committee of National liberation. The future of Poland was discussed at
length at the Yalta Conference of Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt. No agreement
could be reached on the exact boundary of Poland. But Poland ultimately came into
the Soviet camp. The sovietisation of Poland became a landmark in the origin of the
Cold War.
The second crucial area of conflict was the Balkan. Britain and the Soviet Union had
decided to have their own spheres of influence in the Balkan areas. But in all the
countries except Greece communist regimes were installed, and once the communist
governments were installed they were openly supported by the Soviet Union. Except
Greece, which came under British control, all other East European countries fell under
Soviet domination. Churchill’s formulation of this state of affairs was that an ‘iron cur-
tain’ had descended over Europe. This led to an intensely strained relationship between
the East and the West, including between the USA and the Soviet Union.
After the unconditional surrender to the Allied forces, Germany was divided into
four occupation zones-each one under the control of the Soviet Union, the USA,
Britain and France. Berlin, the capital of Germany, fell in Soviet occupation zone but
Berlin itself was divided into four occupation zones on the same pattern as the whole
of Germany. The military occupation was a temporary arrangement till the time the
Peace Treaty was concluded. The Potsdam Conference was convened to finalise the
peace treaty with Germany. The Allies were not clear on critical issues, such as
whether Germany should be disarmed, demilitarised and partitioned. To what degree
was the reconstruction of the German industry to be allowed? The Soviet Union
wanted a pauperised and weak Germany so that its interests did not get threatened by
Germany. The Soviet Union also demanded US$ 20 billion from Germany as repara-
tion fees. But the western allies did not agree to these proposals. Later the British,
American and French zones were merged into one and Federal Republic of Germany
(West Germany) came into existence. After the election in the new state a pro-west
government came to power. It started getting heavy financial aid from America.
Soon, with the Soviet help the other zone also created a state called German
Democratic Republic (East Germany).
The western allies wanted to introduce monetary reforms in Germany, but the Soviet
Union did not and responded by what is known as the Berlin Blockade. The Soviet
Union imposed a total ban on all traffic between Berlin and the western zones, be it
road, rail or waterways. This Blockade was also in protest against the Brussels
Pact which was formulated as a mutual defense treaty between Britain, France and
Belgium. The Pact directed the signatories to extend military assistance to any"

 member state in case of attack by Germany or any third party in Europe. Though the
name of the Soviet Union was not mentioned in the text it was mainly aimed against
the Soviet Union and not against Germany.
In Iran a crisis developed when Soviet troops failed to withdraw by March 1946. Iran
had been the main thoroughfare for western aid to the Soviet Union during the war.
Iran was also rich in oil. The Soviet Union demanded privileged access to Iranian oil
and refused to allow Iranian troops in the Soviet held areas. US then mounted pres-
sure in the United Nations Security Council forcing the Soviet forces to leave Iran.

 THE COLD WAR  ERA AND ITS POLITICS
In Turkey, the Soviet Union demanded the internationalisation of the Bosporus Strait.
The western allies resisted that. In Greece, the USA and the Soviet Union backed
rival factions. The Greek conservative forces had called upon the USA for support.
It was in this backdrop that the US President Truman formulated his policy which
came to be known as Truman doctrine. The Truman doctrine was a policy of ‘con-
tainment’ i.e., to limit or contain communism to areas where it had already triumphed,
but to not let it spread any further. Thus, the American foreign policy changed from
one of isolationism to become interventionist. This intervention was aimed at contain-
ing the spread of communism anywhere in the world.
There was a significant rise of communism in some of the western European coun-
tries also. The war-torn countries of Europe had hoped for improvement in their lot
after the war but that did not happen. European national economies and industries
were struggling and the members of the communist parties in these countries were
increasing. It was in this background that U.S. Secretary of State, Marshall, put
forward his plan for European economic reconstruction which is known as ‘The
Marshall Plan’. The Plan envisaged American transfer of more than ten billion
dollars to Europe over a period of twenty years. It was hoped that such massive
monetary infusion would help Europe recuperate from the ravages of the war and
thus stabilize its material condition and political climate. It was also believed that only
a stable Europe would be able to resist the indigenous and external communist chal-
lenges. Significantly, the offer of aid was made to East European countries also.
On its part the Soviet Union revived the ‘Cominform’ (Communist Information Bu-
reau) in response to the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. It was founded with
the intention to bring the communist governments in the Soviet sphere of influence in
line with Moscow’s policies. Thus, it was an attempt to further consolidate Commu-
nism in Eastern Europe.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation was signed on April 4, 1949. This treaty
was signed in pursuance of the policy of “containment”. It was between the US and
other European countries–Britain, France, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Italy,
the Netherlands, Luxemburg, Norway and Portugal. The treaty was a military alli-
ance against the Soviet Bloc. Article V of the NATO treaty is the central provisio
which states that an attack on any member of NATO would be considered as an act
of aggression against all others. However, every member state had the right to decide
on the kind of support it wanted to offer to other member states. Later, Greece and
West Germany also joined the NATO.
Post-1945 developments in China  and Korea led to the intensification of the Cold
War. In China, the Communists gained power in 1949 under Mao Tse-Tung and
People’s Republic of China was established (See Unit 5.5.7). The United States
refused to recognise the People’s Republic of China, which was also denied entry
into the United Nations; only Taiwan (‘Nationalist’ China) was recognized. The United
States used its power of veto to keep communist China out of the U.N. and the Soviet
Union effectively boycotted the U.N. because of this. However, this did not mean the
establishment of friendly relations between the USSR and PRC: after 1950 their
relations took a turn for the worse.
After the defeat of Japan in the World War II, Korea was divided into North Korea
under Soviet control and South Korea under American control in accordance with the
Potsdam Conference. South Korea was effectively a dictatorship with direct support"

from the USA. In North Korea a pro-Soviet Government was set up. Neither the
Soviet Union nor the U.S.A. recognised the governments which were opposed to
them. In 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea. The United Nations, whose per-
manent Security Council was dominated by capitalist states, declared North Korea
the aggressor and set up a unified UN command to repel the North Korean attack.
General MacArthur of the USA was named its commander. The UN troops pushed
North Korean forces out of South Korea and entered deep into the North Korean
territory, reaching the Chinese border. China then joined the North Korean troops to
push the UN troops into South Korea. Ultimately an armistice was signed in 1953
bringing to an end the threat of an open war. The Korean crisis was the first military
struggle of the Cold War. The USA and USSR and PRC did not engage in much
direct combat with one another (although North Korean aircrafts were actually flown
by Soviet pilots) but they fought each others’ client powers (the Republic of Korea
and the Democratic Republic of Korea: neither was actually a democracy!).

25.4 SECOND PHASE OF THE COLD WAR : POST
TRUMAN-STALIN ERA
 In the second phase, tensions eased considerably but there was no end to the Cold
War. In both the countries, there was a leadership change at the highest level. In the
USA President Truman’s tenure came to an end in 1953 and in the Soviet Union
Stalin died in 1953. Stalin was succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev, who retreated on
many of the policies of Stalin. On the policy front, Khrushchev stood for the policy of
relaxation of tension in Europe and admitted Soviet responsibility for some problems
there. On the other hand, he openly suppressed anti-Soviet leaders and ideas in Po-
land and Hungary and denounced as ‘fascist’ the activities of liberals and Catholics
who expressed Polish and Hungarian nationalism. Soviet leaders during this period
also commented critically on racial conflicts in the USA, which they said were inevi-
table consequences of capitalist inequality. For its part, the USA and its clients tried to
stir up anti-Soviet feelings in the East European countries.
The change of leaders in the USSR and Khrushchev’s denunciation of Stalinism
inspired revolts in Poland and Hungry. In 1956, revolt broke out in Poznan city of
Poland but was suppressed. The Communist Party of Poland became divided into"

two factions, one Stalinist and the other owing allegiance to Gomulka. Gomulka’s
faction succeeded and the Communist Party of Poland decided to pursue a “national
road to socialism”. This meant that Poland would have more control over its affairs
as long as it respected Soviet hegemony (for instance, in economic and military af-
fairs) throughout Eastern Europe. Thus, Poland became the second country after
Yugoslavia to follow the path of  “Nationalist Communism”, which most Soviet lead-
ers accepted within limits.
In Hungary people rose in revolt in 1956. The Soviet Union initially agreed to some
reform, but when Hungarians demanded complete withdrawal of the Soviet troops
and Hungary’s withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact (which was set up by the Soviet
Union in response to NATO), the Soviet leadership got annoyed with the ‘New Course’.
The final declaration of Hungary’s neutrality and withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact
led to the execution of Imre Nagy, the then ruler of Hungary and the attack on
Hungary by the Soviet Union. Thus the Soviet Union made it clear that it was not
ready to accept a liberalised communist regime or a multiparty democracy in Poland.
The US did not do much about it as any action on its part would probably have led to
direct confrontation between the Soviet Union and the USA.
After the Chinese Revolution, General Chiang Kai-Shek led his followers across the
Taiwan Strait and set up the Republic of China which continued to represent China in
the UN till 1971. The American policy before 1950 was not to interfere in Taiwan in
the event of attack by the Communist China (Peoples’ Republic of China). But after
the Korean War in 1950, the U.S. policy changed and after 1953 US President
Eisenhower agreed to massive American rearmament of Taiwan.
In 1954, the PRC (China) declared that Taiwan had to be liberated and accordingly
started military operations. The US on its part threatened to use nuclear weapons and
war between the PRC and the US seemed imminent. Communist China showed an
inclination to back down and the NATO states declared they would not support Ameri-
can use of nuclear weapons. During this period the PRC leaders believed that the
advances made by the USSR in the development of long range delivery systems for
nuclear weapons, ICBMs, had tilted the European balance of power in favour of the
Eastern bloc. PRC leaders were not sure what USSR military resurgence would
mean for them; perhaps it would make the USA less likely to threaten the PRC.
When the PRC bombarded Quemoy in 1957, it was the USSR that pressured the
PRC to stop. Ultimately direct Sino-USA war was avoided, but Chinese Communist
suspicion of the USA and USSR increased.
The Suez Canal was constructed in the mid 19 th c. by the British and the French.
The Suez Canal Company enjoyed the right to operate the canal and earn profits for
a period of 99 years commencing 1869. The Egyptian decision to nationalise the Suez
Canal–that is, make it part of Egyptian national territory–in 1956 led to a series of
crises. Britain, France and Israel decided to initiate a concerted military campaign
against Egypt. America was against the use of force. But Israel attacked Egypt in
collusion with Britain and France. This forced the USA to condemn its own allies and
for the first time since the Cold War, the USA and the Soviet Union came together on
this issue. Britain and France had to accept a UN peace keeping force for the canal.
The imperial decline of France, which had tried to remain independent of the USA
security bloc, speeded up after the ‘Suez Crisis’. Britain too was now generally rec-
ognized as being only a second-rate power and junior partner of the USA."

HISTORY
 THE COLD WAR  ERA AND ITS POLITICS
In Cuba Fidel Castro came to power after many years of struggle in 1959. He brought
Cuba closer to the Soviet Union within a few years. The USA cut off diplomatic
relations with Cuba, refused to purchase Cuban sugar and supported an ‘invasion’ of
Cuba in 1961 by anti-Castro Cubans who were living in exile in the USA. The exiles
attempted a landing at the Bay of Pigs. The ‘invasion’ turned out to be a complete
failure as the exiles got no support from the people of Cuba. The Soviet Union then
decided to install a nuclear bomber and ground-to-ground missiles in Cuba (some of
them only 150 km. from the USA). The Soviet Union also dispatched dozens of long-
range missiles to Cuba. (Since 1949, the USA had put bomber and missile bases in
Norway, Turkey and other places directly adjacent to the USSR.) The USA in turn
announced a blockade of Cuba. There was a strong possibility of war between the
superpowers. Initially the Soviet Union denounced the blockade but later agreed to
withdraw the missiles on the condition that the Americans would not invade Cuba and
would remove their medium-range nuclear missiles from Turkey. The USA agreed to
the first condition; they soon removed missiles from Turkey with the excuse that they
were outdated. This was probably the closest the superpowers came to nuclear war
during the Cold War.
The Soviet Union virtually gave an ultimatum to the western powers demanding
demilitarisation of all of Berlin within six months; the USSR would remove its occu-
pation troops if the other occupiers did the same. If agreement was not reached
within six months, the Soviet Union was to transfer its occupation rights in East Berlin
to the German Democratic Republic (‘East Germany’). When Soviet troops sur-
rounded the city, the West Berliners and foreign occupiers were supplied by an ‘air-
bridge’; eventually Soviet leaders decided they could not easily force the Western
powers out of Berlin, the city they had lost 300,000 troops in occupying at the end of
the Second World War. The ‘Berlin Crisis’ was not so much defused as won in
favor of the Western occupation forces.
The Soviet Union continued to be worried during the 1950s by the flight of many
workers and professionals from East Germany to West Germany via Berlin. When
they resumed pressure against the Western occupiers over the Berlin question, the
latter changed some of the terms of occupation to prevent being drawn into a major
conflict over Germany. West Germany, the German Federal Republic, was being re-
armed after 1955 and given effective control over most of the western occupation
zones, where the communists were outlawed for some time. In 1961 the Soviet occu-
piers of East Berlin built a concrete wall to prevent East Germans from fleeing to the
West German state. The Berlin Wall became a symbol of Cold War politics until
Germans tore it down in 1989–90.
During the second phase of the Cold War, there was a thaw between the two super-
powers but on certain occasions, as during the Cuban Missile crisis in 1962, the
tension ran very high. The possibility of a nuclear war and its catastrophic effects
was an important factor that forced the two superpowers to change their attitudes. In
both the countries there were pressures to reduce military expenditures.
Some grounds for improved relationship between the two superpowers had already
been made. In 1963 the Soviet Union, the USA and Britain had signed a nuclear test ban
treaty and agreed to carry out their nuclear tests underground only to avoid polluting the
atmosphere any further. In the same year a telephonic link (the so called hot line) was
introduced between Moscow and Washington to ensure swift consultations."

25.5 THE DETENTE
The Soviet Union and the USA relationship now entered a new phase which has been
described as Detente, a term that was used for relaxation in East-West conflict. The
Detente was also to take into account China. The relationship between the USA and
China had been tense for past few years. The Detente with China was a notable
achievement. The Cold War did not end during this period but there were improved
levels of understanding. Henry Kissinger, an American official, described Detente as
“a mode of arrangement of adversary power”. Leonid Brezhnev, who succeeded
Khrushchev as Soviet leader after the Cuban missile crisis, described Detente as
“willingness to resolve differences and disputes not by force, not by threats and saber
rattling, but by peaceful means at the conference table. It also means a certain trust
and ability to consider each other’s legitimate interests.” President Nixon of the USA
has been described as the “author of Detente”. But this is more appropriate in the
context of U.S.-China relations. Although Nixon had based his political career during
the 1940s-60’s as an anti-communist ‘hardliner’, when elected President in 1968 he
took steps to improve US relations with China.
Several steps were taken by both the countries to ease the tension. In 1968, a nuclear
non-proliferation treaty (NPT) was signed by U.K., USA and USSR. A major area of
conflict between the two superpowers was the two Germanys and Berlin. In 1969,
the government of West Germany initiated the policy of Ostpolitik which means a
“policy for the East”. West Germany renewed normal relations with East European
countries. Both the Germanys recognised each other and were recognised as sepa-
rate and legitimate states by the superpowers; the two Germanys joined the United
Nations in 1973. In 1972 USA and the Soviet Union signed the Strategic Arms
Limitation Treaty (SALT-I). The agreement did not reduce the amount of arma-
ments but did slow down the arms race. The then Presidents of the Soviet Union and
the USA met thrice (Brezhnev and Nixon respectively). The USA also started ex-
porting wheat to the Soviet Union. In July 1975, 35 countries assembled for the
Helsinki (Finland) Conference. The signing of its final act was regarded, for the
time being, as burying the Cold War. The final act contained ten principles, most
important of which was that all the Nations were to accept the European frontier
which had been drawn after the Second World War. Thus the division of Germany
was accepted. The communist countries promised to allow their peoples “human
rights” including freedom of speech and freedom to leave the country."

sion with China. In 1971, China was admitted to the UN and Taiwan was expelled. In

25.6 NEW COLD WAR
After the Helsinki Conference the process of detente lost its momentum. Relations
between the USA and the Soviet Union became so sore that by 1980 it appeared that
Cold War had come back. The new tensions came to be described as the New Cold
War. The New Cold War was different from the Cold War in the sense that it was not
based on ideological conflict but on balance of power. In the New Cold War a new
power bloc, namely the PRC, emerged as a power that could not be defeated or
ignored. The intervention of the Soviet army in Afghanistan in 1979 was the turning
point. The New Cold War was marked by the efforts of both the countries to spread
their influence mainly outside Europe. Conflicts outside Europe assumed greater sig-
nificance than ever before. Detente for the Soviet Union meant acceptance of status
quo in Europe only. In Indo-China, Africa, Afghanistan etc. both the countries sup-
ported opposing groups. The Soviet Union replaced the President of Afghanistan by
one favourable to it. Nearly 1, 00,000 Soviet soldiers were stationed in Afghanistan.
America regarded the positioning of Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan as a threat to Iran
and moved her warships in the Gulf. Both the countries were deeply involved in
developing the new weapons of destruction. The US President, Ronald Reagan,
approved of the plan to develop a new weapons system, the Strategic Defence
Initiative (SDI) which was also known as Star Wars.
25.7 THE END OF THE COLD WAR
The New Cold War came to an end with the collapse of communism  in various
East European countries. The pace of collapse was very fast and ultimately commu-
nism collapsed in its birth place i.e., the USSR. The process began in Poland in 1988
when the Solidarity trade union organised huge anti-government strikes forcing the
government to allow free elections in which the communists were comprehensively"

defeated. The same happened in Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania and Czechoslovakia.
In East Germany the communist leader Eric Honecker wanted to disperse the dem-
onstrators by force but was overruled by his colleagues. By the end of 1989, the
Communist Government had to resign in East Germany and the Berlin Wall, the
symbol of Cold War, was pulled down in 1989 with much public enthusiasm. The fall
of the Berlin wall was taken to be the end of the Cold War as its erection had been
taken as the start of the Cold War. In 1990 the West German currency was intro-
duced in East Germany and finally the two Germanys were reunited. The Chancellor
of Federal Republic of Germany was chosen as the head of the Government of the
united country which adopted market economy and western type of democracy.
In the Soviet Union also communism collapsed. Mikhail Gorbachev made efforts to transform
and revitalize the country by his policies of glasnost (openness) and Perestroika (restructur-
ing-which meant economic and social reforms). But the measures did not succeed and by the
end of 1991 the USSR split into separate republics, and Russia alone was not in a position to
command the same influence that the old Soviet Union did. The Cold War came to an end.
Many political commentator argued that with the end of the Cold War the world problems
would disappear but new problems and new areas of conflict have now emerged.

WHAT YOU HA VE LEARNT
The Cold War started immediately after the Second World War, though signs of it had
started appearing during the war. In the early phase of the Cold War, there were at-
tempts by the USA and the USSR to spread their areas of influence and ideology. There
was suspicion and distrust against each other. During the second phase there was some
relaxation in the tension between the two countries. The suspicion and distrust, how-
ever, persisted. Immediately after the Detente, a New Cold War started. A new power
bloc i.e. the PRC emerged during this period. Only with the collapse of communism in
East European countries and in the USSR did the Cold War come to an end.

 NATIONAL LIBERATION
MOVEMENTS, DECOLONISATION
AND DEVELOPMENT, 1945-PRESENT
26
Notes
During the twentieth century, millions of people living under colonial rule were di-
rectly or indirectly involved in ‘national freedom’ struggles. Between 1945 and 1980,
nearly all the parts of Asia, Africa, Oceana (islands in the western Pacific Ocean)
and the Caribbean that had been under European, Japanese and American rule won
freedom and organized themselves into new, independent nation-states.
During the Second World War (1939-1945), the imperialist and expansionist goals of
the defeated powers, Germany and Japan, were thwarted. Even the victorious colo-
nial powers, Great Britain, France and the Netherlands, were unable to keep their
imperial commitments, and their leaders faced growing pressure to ‘decolonise’– not
only from their colonial subjects and national citizens but also from the two new
‘superpowers’, the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. Most of West Africa, the Philippines
(an Asian colony of the U.S.A.) and some other places achieved independence with-
out much violence after 1945. In Algeria, Indochina, Malaya, Angola, Mozambique
and other places only years of armed struggle by freedom movements led to national
independence.
Political independence did not immediately bring all the benefits colonised people had
dreamed of. New states faced problems of economic development and modernisation
that they needed to solve in order to resist ‘neocolonialism’. Standards of living in
most of the new independent states did not match those of the ‘developed’ countries
of Western Europe and North America, and many people today argue that forms of
colonial domination or old patterns of exploitation still remain in the world of formally
independent nation-states.
OBJECTIVES
After studying the lesson, you will be able to:
• learn about some national freedom movements;
• analyse global political forces affecting the decolonisation process;
• discuss relationships of dependency and inequality in the post-colonial world and
• identify some of the problems of national development and some proposed
solutions."

HISTORY
 NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENTS
26.1 MODELS OF NATIONAL LIBERATION AND NATIONAL
DEVELOPMENT. BEGINNINGS OF DECOLONISATION
Models
Leaders of national liberation struggles of the twentieth century were inspired by
earlier examples of national liberation and development which had introduced the
modern idea of citizenship–that all members of a nation should enjoy equal rights and
responsibilities.
The American war of independence was followed by the emergence of stable, demo-
cratic governing institutions in the new United States of America, and the gradual
extension of rights of full citizenship to all members of the American nation. Also, the
American military remained small and did not often interfere with the working of civil
institutions. This was very attractive to people in colonies in Asia and Africa where
the military was regularly used to control the population.
The French revolution in 1789 did not begin as a struggle against a foreign power, but
the revolutionaries launched a campaign to spread ‘universal principles’ of Liberty,
Equality and Fraternity to other parts of Europe. The French revolution inspired people
in Europe and in the French colonies to revolt against French domination–in the
name of these principles. Not all of these national revolutionaries believed deeply in
democracy or equality, but most believed that ‘the people’ needed to be mobilised to
fight against foreign domination.
There were other reasons why people under colonial rule admired the American
model of national freedom and development. Americans developed the world’s larg-
est economy between 1865 and 1950, based on capitalist agriculture, heavy industry
and mass consumer spending. Many people around the world believed that the U.S.A.
was sincerely committed to self-governance through democracy on a global scale,
and that it would act as a force against colonialism, perhaps by directly assisting
colonial subjects in their national liberation struggles.
The Russian (Bolshevik) Revolution of 1917–1921 had a huge global impact. The
Bolsheviks argued that different ‘nationalities’ all over the world have a right to inde-
pendence and to decide their own future. The Russian revolution also presented an
alternative model of rapid social and economic ‘development’ different from that of
the capitalist Western states. Many Soviet citizens in 1941 enjoyed a higher material
standard of living than had their grandparents.
The Soviet leaders gave ‘moral’ and material support to people of many politically-
and economically-dominated countries and colonies. Marxist theory taught that small
peasants and proletarians around the world shared the same interests and needed to
cooperate to defeat the bourgeoisie and the imperialists. Some colonial nationalists
visited or studied in the U.S.S.R. in order to learn to organise national freedom struggles.
These included the Vietnamese nationalist Ho Chi Minh, the Chinese nationalist leader
Chiang Kai-Shek (1887–1975), and Jawaharlal Nehru, the Indian National Congress
leader who believed in democratic socialism and thought that aspects of the Soviet
command economy might be imitated by India.
Beginnings of decolonization
Great Britain and France were forced to respond to some of the growing agitations
for self-governance and ‘home-rule’. As early as 1867, Britain started granting"

effective home-rule to Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and parts of Canada,
regions where Europeans had settled in large numbers since the 1600s, displacing or
killing the ‘natives’. White, settler colonists in those places were allowed to make
decisions about ‘domestic’ affairs through elected legislatures and parliaments, but
their relations with other colonies and nation-states were regulated by imperial
authorities in London. After 1910, these colonial states were referred to as Domin-
ions or a British Commonwealth of co-operative nations. Britain also granted com-
monwealth status to the Union of South Africa (where Europeans were greatly out-
numbered by black Africans, but the latter were not allowed to vote, etc.).
Like the British and other Westerners, many French people believed that certain
‘races’ and societies–especially their own–were ‘advanced’, whereas others were
‘primitive’. They argued that it was the moral duty of the “advanced” societies to
guide or teach the more primitive societies. After 1914, small numbers of non-French
people in the French colonies were allowed to participate in governing their societies
by voting for or serving on legislative assemblies.
British, French and Dutch colonial rulers were convinced that people in the colonies
would accept this partial independence for sentimental reasons (e.g., appreciation for
European culture) or because they might enjoy economic benefits from continued
association with the mother country. Many colonies did accept plans of loose federa-
tions under European guidance as a first step towards complete national indepen-
dence. In some colonies, however, for example India, the nationalists continued to
agitate and fight for complete independence.
We should also know that modifications of colonial rule before 1945 did not really
weaken the position of European colonists and benefited only small numbers of ‘na-
tives’ in the colonies.
26.2 IMPACT OF WORLD WAR II ON ANTI-COLONIAL STRUGGLES
World War II radicalised many people in the colonial world who had earlier been
untouched by national freedom movements. In some cases, military struggles of
colonised people against new invaders (principally, the Japanese) turned against the
Europeans who tried to re-occupy the colonies. Africans and Asians were enlisted in
colonial armies to fight the Germans, Italians and Japanese in far corners of the
world, and they learned that Europeans were not undefeatable ‘lords of the earth’.
About five million Indian soldiers served in British-led armies during the war. Asian
and African soldiers had contact with people from other colonies and with European
and American soldiers and civilians. Trained to fight German and Japanese ‘tyranny’,
they presented a new kind of threat to their own colonial rulers. During the 1940s in
Asia, Africa and the Caribbean, colonial subjects engaged in strikes and mass demon-
strations despite attacks by police and soldiers (including their own ‘countrymen’).
By 1945 many more colonised people than before the war were insisting on full
citizenship rights and national liberation, and they were more confident about fighting
those who opposed their demands.
Before 1939 African intellectuals, professionals and civil servants had formed the
basis of nationalist movements. However, after 1945 such leaders faced greater pres-
sure in their own lands from men and women of the peasant and laboring classes to
fight for democratic reforms and independence, and to include stronger demands for
economic equality in their national liberation campaigns."

HISTORY
 NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENTS
In French Indochina, Ho Chi Minh tried to spread communist ideas during the 1930s.
In 1940-1941, the Japanese expelled the French from Indochina and occupied the
region themselves. Ho formed a ‘national people’s front’ (Viet Minh) to throw them
out, and when the French were restored as rulers of Indochina in 1945, with British
and American consent, Ho and the Viet Minh continued to fight the French, and
gained control over much of Indochina by 1954. In that year Vietnam was partitioned
into two, nominally independent states –the northern territory controlled by Ho and
his allies, and the southern half of Vietnam with a growing American political, military
and economic presence. The conflict cost the lives of more than 50,000 Americans
and millions of Vietnamese, but the Vietnamese had forced the biggest imperialist
power of the world to retreat in 1975.
In India there were mass movements against the British all over the country, under
the leadership of the Congress. There were also independent movements of workers
and peasants led by the Communists, and also organizations of youth, students, writ-
ers, women, lower castes. The British were forced to quit in 1947. Independence
came with partition and the formation of two independent states, India and Pakistan.

1867 and 1914.
2. How did the 2 nd world war radicalize people in colonized countries?
3. Name some countries that gained national independence after 1945 through armed
struggle.
26.3 COLONIAL NATIONALISM, FREEDOM STRUGGLES AND
INTERNATIONAL CO–OPERATION
Some colonial nationalist leaders in Asia and Africa after 1945 asked for or received
Soviet or American assistance and they hoped for honest negotiations by new interna-
tional organisations like the United Nations Organisation (based in the U.S.A. from
1945). They also formed regional associations of independent states with similar inter-
ests of national freedom and development. Such associations included the Organisation
for African Unity (O.A.U.), founded in 1963 to arbitrate conflicts between new states
and to pressurise colonial powers to let go of their remaining African dependencies.
Another important development was the emergence of the Non-Aligned Movement
(N.A.M.), including China, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran and Egypt, among other
states. Leaders of twenty-nine states met in Bandung, Indonesia, in 1955, to condemn
imperialism, national aggression, racism and atomic weapons.
The non–aligned movement expressed the need for peaceful cooperation of Third
World states with one another and with both of the superpowers. Leaders of most
participating N.A.M. states wanted to find and follow a middle path that was neither
purely communist nor purely capitalist: there was much talk between the 1950s and"

1970s of Asian and African ‘paths’ to socialism and democracy. Many of the new
states of Africa fell quickly into dictatorships following independence, like Zaire
(a former Belgian colony) under Mobuto Sese Seko (president, 1965–1997) and Uganda
(a former British colony) under Idi Amin Dada (1924–2003, deposed 1979).
Some leaders of Saharan Africa (such as Egypt and Libya) co-operated with states
of the Middle East in economic development matters, and also to force the state of
Israel (formerly British Palestine) to end what they saw as an illegal, semi–colonial
occupation of Palestinian lands. This was part of the Pan-Arab movement. Leaders
of ‘Black Africa’ through the 1970s and ‘80s continued to pressurise white-minority
regimes in Rhodesia and South Africa to end racism and discrimination against blacks;
they gave aid to liberation movements (such as the African National Congress in
South Africa) outlawed by white–minority governments.
Newly independent states faced difficulties of national independence and develop-
ment during the Cold War era (1945–1991). Leaders who were sympathetic–or at
least not hostile–to communism often won popular support. But they faced resistance
when they tried to weaken the position of the old colonial ‘native’ elites.
In Indonesia, the freedom-fighter Achmed Sukarno (1901–1970) had founded during
the 1920s a Nationalist Party of Indonesia (similar to the Indian National Congress).
Sukarno proclaimed Five Principles of national liberation: faith in God, humanitarian-
ism, national independence, democracy and social justice (the latter implying some
central economic guidance and redistribution of wealth). Muslims (the majority reli-
gious community) agreed to rule by a centralised Indonesian state on the condition
that they preserve some local control, especially in matters of religion. During the
1950s, Sukarno also worked with the Chinese-inspired communist people’s move-
ment, but in 1959 he established a dictatorship, although he recognised the legality of
the communist movement. In 1965 Sukarno’s internal enemies (mainly army
officers) deposed him and clamped down on the Indonesian communists, killing hun-
dreds of thousands of them. The U.S.S.R. stood aside as this happened, while the
Americans gave covert support to the army officers. Indonesia remained a military
dictatorship until very recently.

chief figure in the Ghanaian independence struggle (in British West Africa). How-
ever, others lived during the interwar years in the homelands of their colonial rulers,
where they learned political ideas and techniques of organisation. Ho Chi Minh (1894–
1969) lived in France between 1918 and 1930, where he helped establish the French
Communist Party, before he returned to French Indochina to fight for Vietnamese
independence. Léopold Sédar Senghor (1906–2001) was a university professor and
poet in France before returning to his native West Africa to lead the Democratic Bloc
of Senegal; he became the first president of Senegal, 1960-1980.
Decolonisation proceeded rapidly after 1945, in some areas with limited violence and
loss of life. For example, French West Africa was divided into independent Senegal,
Mauritania, Mali, Ivory Coast, Guinea and other states after 1958, while British West
Africa was divided into the independent nation-states of Ghana, Sierra Leone and
Nigeria between 1957 and 1961.
The British imprisoned thousands of Indians during the ‘Quit India’ agitation in 1942,
but the Indian independence struggle thereafter involved less violence between
Indians and British. However, millions of South Asians lost their lives or were dis-
placed across borders in the ensuing partition of the subcontinent into India and Paki-
stan. Independence of some neighboring regions of the former British Raj occurred
with less violence–in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and Burma (now Myanmar).
Morocco and Tunisia in North Africa separated peacefully from France during the
1950s, but neighboring Algeria gained independence (in 1962) only after an eight-year
struggle in which hundreds of thousands of Algerians and thousands of French died.
The people of present-day Angola and Mozambique (in southern Africa) freed them-
selves from Portuguese rule after more than a decade of fighting and heavy loss of
life among Africans and the occupying Portuguese in 1975.
People of present-day Malaysia fought against Japanese occupation during the Second
World War; the same Malayan Anti-Japanese People’s Army then resisted
re-occupation by the British. Over the next ten years, as many as 100,000 British
soldiers were present in Malaya at one time to fight what British leaders called a ‘com-
munist insurgency’. Britain had to withdraw its forces in 1957 and recognised the Fed-
eration of Malaysia as a semi-independent member of the British Commonwealth.
The process of decolonisation had much to do with the politics of the Cold War, that
is the hostility after 1945 between the two superpower blocs: the ‘First World’ led by
the U.S.A. and supposedly upholding capitalist democracy, and the ‘Second World’
system represented by the Soviet Union and emerging socialist states like the People’s
Republic of China. Some states of the newly decolonized Third World benefited from
close alliances with either of the two superpowers.
After the expulsion of the Japanese from Korea in 1945, the northern part of the
Korean peninsula fell under the influence of the U.S.S.R. and the People’s Republic
of China, while the southern part became a dependency of the U.S.A. The Ameri-
cans poured more than ten billion dollars of ‘development assistance’ into South
Korea between 1953 and 1970. Economists from the 1970s were calling South Ko-
rea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore the ‘Little Dragons’ of Asia–the ‘big drag-
ons’ being Japan and the People’s Republic of China–because of their rapidly grow-
ing economies based on production of industrial goods (e.g., steel, ships, electronic
equipment) for export. The Little Dragons all benefited from massive grants and"

In Africa however the European states invested only small amounts in their African
possessions for education, health care and other human development needs. Even in

remained nearly as poor, ill educated and politically powerless as their ancestors had

26.5 CHINA: NATIONAL LIBERATION, TWO STATES
In 1911–1912, the Chinese autocratic system headed by an emperor was formally
abolished and replaced by a republic, but the new republic was unable to throw off
foreign domination. From the late 1920s, Communists led by Mao Zedong (1893–
1976), Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping and others fought against the Chinese Nationalists
(Guomindang), and both groups tried to expel the Japanese, who exercised territorial
and economic control since the 1890s.
Mao believed that Chinese nationalists were unwilling to bring about social and eco-
nomic changes that would emancipate the Chinese masses, and that they were too
corrupt to resist the foreigners. The Chinese Communists therefore not only forced
the Japanese, French and British out of most of the ‘national’ territory by 1949, but
also drove their opponents, the Goumindang, Chinese ‘Nationalists’, to the island of
Formosa–present-day Taiwan–across a narrow strait from mainland China . Hong
Kong was a British Crown Colony until 1997. Their ultimate goal remained to reunify
Taiwan with the Chinese mainland, which became a separate state.
Since 1945, China has experienced probably the greatest revolution in history, trans-
forming itself from a peasant-majority society dominated by native elites (and by the
British, French, British and Americans who controlled much of the country’s trade),
into a socialist state called the People’s Republic of China (P.R.C.). A socialist state
meant state owned industrial enterprises and a policy leading to collectivized agricul-
ture, with land owned collectively.
Since the 1980s, however, the C.C.P. leadership has promoted free enterprise in
manufacturing and commercial activities. By 1993, less than ten percent of P .R.C.
industrial production was under central planning. The P.R.C. since the 1980s has
welcomed hundreds of billions of (U.S.A.) dollars in foreign investment from coun-
tries that are China’s ideological opponents. Some economists estimate that the P.R.C.
will have the world’s largest economy by 2020, as China did before 1800, but"

economic liberalisation and relaxing of some government controls have also reversed
the trend of 1949–1980, when the goal of the C.C.P. was to make Chinese more
equal in every possible way.
While the P.R.C. condemned Western aggression and the development of nuclear weap-
ons, it became one of the nuclear-weapon states by the early 1960s. Chinese leaders
justified their military buildup by pointing to the fact that American leaders had consid-
ered dropping nuclear bombs on the P.R.C. during the Korean War (1950–1953). At the
same time, P.R.C.-U.S.S.R. relations worsened during the 1950s as Mao believed
Marxism-Leninism needed to be adjusted to Chinese conditions and he and some other
leaders feared Soviet domination. During the 1960s and ‘70s, the Soviets gave military
assistance to the Vietnamese communists in their struggle against the U.S.A., but the
P.R.C. refused to support the Vietnamese communist movement. In this same period
the P.R.C. was assisting pro-communist people’s struggles in Africa. Chinese develop-
ment assistance was extended to many Third World countries.

26.6 PROBLEMS OF ‘DEVELOPMENT’ IN THE POST–COLONIAL
WORLD
During and after the Second World War, leaders of the Great Powers recognised
more equitable global distribution of wealth as essential to world peace and stability.
After 1945 new global institutions like the U.N.O., the International Monetary Fund
(I.M.F.) and the World Bank were established in order to manage conflicts over
wealth production and access to trade. The I.M.F. organises loans to states that do
not earn enough from their exports to ‘balance’ their expenditure on imports. The
World Bank loans money to states, often as supplement to ‘development assistance’,
to pay for irrigation and hydroelectric systems, and other infrastructure improve-
ments that are supposed to increase productivity and economic security.
Many people have however, argued that these institutions have favored the interests
of the countries that were already developed. The I.M.F. has required governments
receiving loans to reduce their deficits, which those governments have often had to
do by reducing ‘social spending’ (e.g., funding for health, education, housing). The
I.M.F. has also advised governments to devalue their currencies, which has made
their export products cheaper in the world market.
The permanent Security Council of the U.N.O. after 1945 consisted of the U.S.S.R.,
the U.S.A., Nationalist China (until the 1970s), Great Britain, and France. During the"

Cold War, Britain and France sided with the U.S.A. on about two-thirds of the issues
that came up for vote in the Security Council –reinforcing American preferences and
decisions about world politics, including economic issues.
To some people in Asia, Africa and Latin America, claims by leaders of developed,
capitalist societies about freedom and justice often seemed a sham, and the policies
designed by them appeared hypocritical. At the same time, wider exposure of people
around the world to ‘Western’ capitalist lifestyles–through magazines, cinema and
television–has led them to acquiesce to Western (especially American) ways of
organising economic and other activity.
W. W. Rostow, an American economist believed that former colonies could follow the paths
taken by early industrial states like Britain and by expanding their agricultural production and
following free-trade policies, could accumulate the capital to develop industry, and thus move
into economic modernity. This concept of development is known as ‘modernisation theory’.
While countries like Argentina and later Brazil tried to follow this model and did
develop some industry, many other Latin American, African and Asian countries
showed signs of ‘development crisis’ between the 1960s and 1980s: stalled
industrialisation, and increasing poverty. Foreign companies in Latin America after
1960 took out far more money (as profits) than they had invested there. Loans from
private banks and bodies like the I.M.F. did not improve the situation: during the
1980s, Latin American states had to make loan repayments totaling more than $200
billion (U.S.A. dollars). In the early 1990s, more than sixty percent of Latin American
households did not earn enough to cover basic needs such as food, clothing and
shelter. In Africa, the economic situation was still worse: some African states like
Zaire and Burundi experienced ‘negative growth’ during the 1980s.
Economists and political scientists in Latin America criticised the arguments made by
economists like Rostow and the development policies promoted by some Western
leaders. This critique is sometimes called ‘dependency theory’ or ‘underdevelopment
theory’. Raul Prebisch and other ‘dependency theorists’ claimed that centuries of
Spanish and Portuguese rule, followed by decades of economic domination by Brit-
ain, the U.S.A. and other states, had left most Latin Americans unable to exercise
their freedom, especially with regard to material circumstances like employment and
use of economic resources. Like Prebisch, Walter Rodney in Africa in the 1970s
observed that colonies could not easily pull out of the ‘dependency patterns’ created
during the centuries of colonialism. (See discussion of imperialism in Unit 5.1.) They
claimed that agriculture would remain backward until large landowners ceased ex-
ploiting the poorer peasants and laborers: large estates (like the zamindari in India)
should be broken up and land redistributed to peasantry.
Many successful political leaders in the ‘Third World’, based on experience of Soviet
Union and China, have followed economic development strategies based on state
ownership or control of enterprises and resources. They have also tried to prevent
mass outflows of profits to foreign investors and states, and to lift up the poor through
free education, more affordable health care, and so forth. For example, in Cuba Fidel
Castro (1927– ) led a nationalist revolution during the late 1950s, and has been follow-
ing such policies that favour the interests of the Cuban people. The Castro revolution
has been popular among some Latin Americans who resent continuing foreign influ-
ence and dictatorships of their countries propped up by the U.S.A. Majority of the
Cubans enjoy a better standard of living than people in richer countries."

Other Latin American leaders after 1960 followed the Cuban example in some re-

foreign corporations. However, he was deposed and killed in 1973 by internal

until 1990. More recently, Hugo Chavez (1954– ), an army officer elected president
of Venezuela in 1998, has used revenues from state-owned oil companies to lift Ven-
ezuelans out of poverty. Government spending on social programs was increased
dramatically during the first years of his presidency, and he has been able to resist the
US quite effectively. The rule of Castro in Cuba and the rise of Chavez in Venezuela
show the strength in the parts of the developing world of nationalist and pro-people
patterns of development.

WHAT YOU HA VE LEARNT
The world today is divided into nation-states that are formally free to conduct their
own affairs. European states no longer rule territories much larger and more popu-
lous than themselves. Hundreds of national freedom struggles, some beginning
before the Second World War, were successful after the war. While there contin-
ues to be aggression among nations and ‘national’ separatist movements (of people
wanting to join other nations or form their own nations), there are also transnational
institutions and organisations that exist to minimise such conflicts. Some of these
organisations were established to help ‘develop’ former colonies and other poorer
regions of the world. Yet more than fifty years after the surge of national freedom
struggles, five or six states control more wealth than all of the rest combined: the
debate about unequal economic power in the world also continues.

GLOSSARY
Decolonization       – The process of the reverse of imperialism, with colo
nies becoming politically independent states.  His
torically, decolonization usually refers to the period
1945-90.
Cold War                          – The period 1945-1990, when the two new ‘super
powers’ (USA and USSR) did not directly fight each
other (‘hot war’) but instead tried to oppose each
other’s expansion through proxy wars.  Key con
flicts of the Cold War were the USSR aiding the
Vietnamese national liberation struggle and the USA
assisting Afghan freedom fighters in their struggle
against occupation by the USSR.
Non-Aligned Movement  – An association of former colonized states since the
1950s trying to avoid new dependency on the ‘su
perpowers’, the USA and the USSR.  NAM states
include India, Pakistan, Egypt, Cuba and Indonesia.
Despite pledges of non-alignment, some NAM states
did become ‘dependent’ on one or another of the
superpowers in matters of military defense or in trade
and economic exchange.
Third World       – A term invented during the early 1950s to indicate
former colonial territories in need of ‘development’
(economic modernization).  The First World refers
to wealthy capitalist or non-socialist states including
UK, USA and Canada.  Second World refers (until
1990) to the USSR and others European states fol
lowing its path of socialist development: for example
Poland, Bulgaria.
Development assistance   – Grants of money or financial loans given by wealthy
states (or associations of such states) to poorer ones"

to assist their economic modernization.  During the
Cold War, development assistance was often used
by superpowers or their allies to push former colo
nized states into cooperation with the USA or the
USSR.
Modernization theory       – A theory of economic development introduced dur
ing the 1950s by American economist W. W. Rostow.
Rostow believed that economic development and
modernization would involve industrialization, but that
this would be preceded by capitalist agricultural de
velopment.  Roughly speaking, Britain, the USA and
Germany were the examples to be followed by Third
World countries in their development.
Market socialism        – Term used by leaders of the People’s Republic of
China to describe their mixed or combined strategy
of development since 1980.  Instead of strong cen-
tral (economic) planning and state ownership of re
sources (means of production) throughout the entire
country, as happened before 1980, capitalists are al
lowed to generate profits for their investors, includ-
ing foreign partners.  Special ‘free enterprise zones’
are recognized in which the Chinese state allows
capitalism to operate."

Notes
In lesson 26 you learnt about the changes that came with colonial expansion and
capitalist industrialization in the 19 th century. In this lesson we will carry over the
discussion into the 20 th century, which saw the acceleration and deepening of the
social processes that characterized the 19th century: some of them quite irreversible
and profound in their impact on human life.
The last decades of the 20 th century saw the collapse of the socialist societies in
Europe and the collapse of the capitalist welfare state as well. It saw increasing
inequalities between the capitalist countries and within the capitalist countries. We
will point towards some of these and the differences in social transformation be-
tween capitalist and socialist societies as well.
OBJECTIVES
After studying the lesson, you will be able to:
• discuss how development of industrialisation to large parts of the world contrib-
uted to fundamental changes in society everywhere;
• recognise that there were differences in these processes between the advanced
countries and those that won their freedom from colonialism in the 20th century;
• note some of the social changes over time even within the advanced countries and
• identify the differences between capitalist and socialist countries.
27.1 DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES
The pattern of demographic changes noticed in the 19 th century continued into the
20th century.  In the 1990s the world contained five or six billion human beings, per-
haps three times as many people as at the outbreak of World War I: this is despite an
estimated 187 million deaths during the century due to various causes, including
natural deaths.
 There was a sustained growth in world population throughout the 20 th century. In
Western Europe and North America this was mainly due to better health facilities
and decline in infant mortality, and expansion of social security systems which al-
lowed for longer lives. In Eastern Europe and on the other continents the increase
was because birth rates continued to be high."
dgx\sr. secondary history.pdf,"156 HISTORY
MODULE - 5
Contemporary World
Notes
 Social Transformation
But from 1930 we find a downward trend in Eastern Europe as well, and by 1960s
almost the whole of Europe had low fertility, but this was offset by low mortality
rates. So over all there was growth of population throughout the developed world.
However, population growth in Europe was negatively effected by the two world
wars of the 20th century. This was mainly due to the huge numbers killed, but also
because of delayed marriages and disruption of family lives.
The developing societies experienced rapid population growth after 1945, at rates
greater than the West. Here better medical facilities became available in the 20 th
century, but at the same time older structures of society dominated by agriculture
(where more children meant more family labour and security for parents) meant a
more rapid demographic growth.
A comparison therefore shows that at the end of the century what we call the west-
ern world contained just 1/6 of the world population.
Demographic changes involved changes in patterns of human settlements and in distri-
bution of population as well. For example, continued migrations remained an important
factor affecting population distribution in the twentieth century.  1901 to 1915 saw the
most intensive out-migration from Europe. Southern and Eastern Europe were espe-
cially areas of out migration, north Europe both sent out and received migrants, while
western Europe received people rather than have them move out. These migration
patterns were due to push and pull of labour demand and of political factors. For ex-
ample, Nazi policies resulted in forced migrations of Jews, minorities and political pris-
oners from Germany, while post war reconstruction led to migration into Germany of
Turkish workers. Civil wars in Russia and Spain similarly resulted in out migrations.
Thus we can see that population growth and population shifts were a result of many
factors. Today there is a migration to the western world from poorer countries, but
mostly of skilled and qualified middle classes, while those who are poor have no
chances to migrate there because of strict restrictions by these countries. Some mi-
grations of poorer population do take place to the Middle East, however.
Son preference has destroyed the gender balance in countries like India and China,
and has become a matter of great concern.
27.2 URBANIZATION
Modern urban life is specifically connected with capitalist industrialization. Urbanization
means growth of towns and a faster growth of town population as compared with rural
population. Urbanization is therefore a result of not just natural growth in population, but
also of shift of population from countryside to towns because of industrialization and
greater economic opportunities in towns. You have read something about these pro-
cesses in Unit 1. This process was not uniform throughout the world, and not even
throughout Europe, or within a country, and did not come about all of a sudden.
There was a great divergence in rhythm of change between industrial and non-indus-
trial areas, and areas where agriculture had become mechanized and not become mecha-
nized. With industrialization most people came to be employed in the production of
manufactured goods and services, both of which were concentrated in towns and cities.
In 1900 UK, the country that industrialized first, was still the most urbanized country
with a 77% urban population, while Germany, which by then had a faster pace of"

industrialization, had about 56% living in urban areas. Other countries still had less
than half its people living in urban centres. And if we take the world into account, at
the beginning of this century about 70% of the population still lived in rural areas.
During the course of the 20 th century, with significant shifts in production due to
science and technological changes, we find urbanization becoming more widespread.
In UK and USA, by the mid 1970s more than 95 % of the employed population was
engaged in manufacturing and services and less than 5% in agriculture; in Europe
(excluding Russia) by mid 1980s more than 70% lived in urban areas; in Japan, more
than 80% were in manufacturing and services and less than 20% in agriculture.
In countries like Russia even in 1917 the majority of its population was linked with
villages, although the 1930s and the latter half of the century saw rapid urbanization.
In many countries of Asia and Africa, including India, agriculture is still a much bigger
sector in terms of people engaged in it.
Urbanization has meant growth of very large cities of course but also small towns in
developing countries like ours. In 1900 there were 16 cities with more than one million
inhabitants; in 1950 there were 67; and in 1985 more than 250. In the world as a
whole, by 1980 at least 40% of people lived in cities, and it could well be 50% today.
You can see the trend in our own country: thousands of people come to big cities in
search of jobs and livelihood. In fact the developing countries have some of the
largest cities in the world: Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, Cairo, Shanghai, Nairobi, Seoul,
Bangkok etc

2. How did political factors in Germany effect the migration of population?

27.3 MODERN CLASS SOCIETY
Capitalist industrialization resulted in the growth of modern class society, by which
we mean that social classes which existed before it were transformed and integrated
into the capitalist economy and society, and two new social classes also emerged, the
bourgeoisie and working class. Pre-capitalist societies were dominated by landed
wealth and the landed aristocracy. They were crucially affected by capitalist industri-
alization, as and when it emerged in different parts of the world. As with changes in
population and urbanization, changes in social structures were not uniform all over the
world and not sudden.
For much of Europe the 19th century was the crucial period when the landed aristoc-
racy found their lives changed. In England they became modern landlords deriving"

their wealth from rent in land and other capitalist ventures, such as commerce, mines, rail-
ways etc. The continental nobilities retained their dominance well into the twentieth century.
Peasants continued to be an important component of societies even after capitalist
industrialization, and growth of capitalism in agriculture. However, as the capitalist
economy penetrated their lives, peasantry itself became divided into classes—the
rich, the poor and middle peasants—and began to look at property, criminality and
state authority differently. There also emerged a class of landless agricultural labourers.
The absolute numbers of those engaged in agriculture did not decline even in Europe
till the mechanization of agriculture in the 1940s. The relationship with the landlord
continued to be the crucial aspect of their social and political experience.
The second half of the 20 th century has, however, seen the disappearance of the
peasantry almost throughout the western world, and a dramatic fall in countries like
Japan and South East Asia in general. Only Sub-Saharan Africa, India and China
continue to have very large peasantries.
The capitulation by many governments of the Third World—particularly in Asia and
Africa - has resulted in agrarian crises and a very desperate situation for the peas-
antry in these areas. Landlessness is increasing, and enclaves of corporate agricul-
ture have meant a shift to export crops. The demand for export crops from advanced
capitalist countries of the west has resulted in decline of food crop production and
consequent decline in food consumption by the majority of the peasantry. This has led
to thousands of suicides by farmers, and also movements of the peasantry for support
prices, lower costs of inputs, and water and electricity for irrigation. China has been
able to integrate its peasantry very well into its political system, but the market re-
forms of the last two decades are leading to discontent there as well, as there is a
demand on agricultural land for industrial purposes.
The bourgeoisie emerged as the growing and finally the dominant social class in the
20th century. From late 19th century onwards, throughout Western Europe the wealthiest
and most influential sections among the bourgeoisie were the capitalists: industrialists,
the factory owners, the bankers and mine owners. The middle class also included
shopkeepers, managers, lawyers, doctors, engineers, teachers and those in services.
With the expansion of education there was an expansion of this class. During the 20th
century it began to include a significant component of lower middle classes  who
manned the lower paid rung of services. This section was most insecure and worst
affected by the ups and downs in the market, particularly the Depressions in economy.
The formation of the working class, dependent on wage labour, is linked directly
with the growth of capitalist industry. Throughout Europe the working class remained
stratified and differentiated well into the 20th century as mechanization did not come
all of a sudden and not to all the industries at the same time. Some skilled crafts died
out with emergence of big factories, but new skills were required and new skilled
workers were associated with metal working and electrical industries, and later elec-
tronics. But at any given period skilled craftsmen, domestic workers, tailors,
laundrymen, print workers, masons and construction workers, post and telegraph
workers, railway men in a variety of jobs, miners, and skilled and unskilled factory
workers co-existed in all cities. Women formed an important component of these
workers, both in terms of their numbers and also through entry into jobs earlier not
open to them.  All this is equally true of the working classes in the colonized world—
Asia, Africa, Latin America—and later when they became independent."

27.4 CITY AND SOCIAL LIFE
The city and the social life have reflected the strong division of the rich and the poor.
They had different spaces in the city to live in, and the amenities and facilities were
quite different. Multistoried apartments, huge stores and shopping malls, parks and
boulevards have changed the landscape of most modern cities, but these co-exist
with pollution, bad sewage, slums, one room dwellings shared by two or three families
and even homelessness. This continues to be the face of modern cities even today,
anywhere in the world. Unemployment has become a dreaded reality.
27.5 FAMILY
Significant changes came about in both nuclear and joint families with the penetration
of capitalist industrialization. Prior to this economic revolution, the household was
characterized by the inseparability of family functions and labour, though different
tasks may be performed unequally by men and women.
With capitalist industrialisation the family no longer remained the unit of production, though
it continued to be one unit in terms of consumption. The growth of manufactures and
factories meant wage labour; each person in the family earned separately. With bourgeois
values predominating, a man’s wage began to be considered the “family wage” i.e, a
whole family was meant to survive on it, and women’s work ideally was home and nurtur-
ing of children. This was, however, a middle class value that better off working class
families could aspire to, but was hardly the norm for most working class people.
Women of the working class were as much wage workers as men were. In fact many
industries preferred women or children as employees because they could get away
with paying them less. In practice the concept of equal pay for equal work did not apply
to women.
In Practices
In the modern world women usually bear the double burden of earning a wage and
primarily doing the domestic work as well. It is a situation all of you must be familiar with.

tic service women now worked in shops and offices, and as nurses and school teachers:
these came to be seen as primarily feminine jobs. The two world wars opened new
possibilities for women as they manned many jobs left vacant by men mobilized for war.
All this brought a change in the social position and expectations of women.
Middle class women demanded the vote, and the suffragette movements became an
important aspect of their assertions for equality. The real fillip for women’s emanci-
pation in the western world came from the rise of labour and socialist movements,
which spoke for all oppressed, and called for the transformation of the whole society
along lines that would ensure equality for all, including women. Women saw this as
more realistic. Women formed a good percentage of union members and also of
socialist organizations, although they were not so visible in leadership roles. It was not
easy for women to assert equality even in these organizations, and demands for equal
pay came only when women or enlightened socialist leaderships stressed on it.
Roza Luxemburg and Beatrice Webb were celebrated socialist leaders, Colette and
Selma Lagerlof were important writers, and women were already participating in
tennis tournaments like Wimbledon, French and US Open in the early twentieth cen-
tury. Women took up journalism and photography as professionals, and became doc-
tors and engineers. Soviet Union had a large percentage of women in its mass orga-
nizations and in the central parliament, and in scientific establishments.
In Russia the working class movement had a significant component of women, and
peasant women were part of the general revolutionary movement. In Russia and in
the anti-colonial movements they found a much more favourable environment for
mass participation. In countries like India and China, questions of women’s education,
and opposition to backward social practices were part and parcel of the national
liberation struggles, and both men and women expressed them very boldly, with the
result that in India and China women won their vote as free citizens along with men.
The same was true for women in Russia after the Russian revolution of 1917.
By 1990 women were or had been heads of government in sixteen states. Their
numbers in the workforce grew dramatically in the Asian, African and Latin Ameri-
can countries. Mauritius is a significant example. In China and in Eastern Europe
there has been almost 100% employment of women.
All this is not to say that women’s battle for equality is over; it is not so anywhere in
the world. The neo-liberal economic policies from the 1990s have led to increase in
unemployment. Women have borne the brunt of it all over the world, including in the
former socialist countries. In the Third World countries, women have been pushed
into the unorganized sector, with least protection of worker rights and no guarantee of
minimum wage. Domestic service is still a major source of employment for women.
In India female infanticide and female foeticide have increased in the last decade of
the 20th century. Dowry deaths in India, and domestic violence in general have also
been on the increase all over the world.
27.7 CHANGES IN WORK PATTERNS
As and when the factory system developed, work patterns changed. In Europe this
was in the 19th century, but in much of the rest of the world only in the 20th century.
The workplace of the worker became the factory; he/she had to follow set hours of
work; women and children also went out to work and had to follow the rhythm of the
factory; there was an elaborate system of factory discipline, rules and regulations;"

and now it was not the worker, but the machine which decided the form and pace of
work. Introduction of new technology sometimes rendered one set of workers redun-
dant and therefore caused distress and unemployment; at others times they had to
learn new skills in order to adapt themselves to new machinery.
In the latter part of the century, another set of changes have taken place in work
patterns. Some of the big firms in the western countries have found that with comput-
ers it is possible to work from home and cheaper for them because they need not
spend on office maintenance. These changes were presented as benefiting employ-
ees, but in fact have meant that employees never fully get off the job; they cannot
claim “leave” and other benefits that employees can get because they do not work in
an office; and no opportunity to form trade unions or share grievances with other
employees.
New types of software allow employers to more closely monitor the work and work
time of the employee through the computer networks. You would have read in the
newspapers, about the working conditions of the people who work in BPOs and call
centres that are mushrooming in our country today.
Another set of changes has come from what is called out-sourcing. Big trans-national
companies have found it easier to shift some of their functions to Third World coun-
tries, where wages are low, and where they can bully governments to ensure that
those enterprises remain “trouble free” and enjoy tax benefits. This has meant unem-
ployment for workers in the western countries, and some jobs for people in Third
World countries, but on extremely unfavourable terms.
Big multinational companies have also brought back the era of sweat shops, where
they contract jobs to small enterprises, which means production often takes place at
home. Here the pay scales are lowest and the workers most exploited. This section of
workers has increased in third world countries, with mostly women having to perform
these jobs.

twentieth century. Apart from political parties and trade unions among various sec-

have all kinds of viewpoints and aspirations reflected organizationally: on education,
public health, minority rights, human rights, peace movements, culture, gay rights,
environment and conservation, credit and self-help groups. Almost no area of life
remains unrepresented. Many of these organizations have demands and aspirations
that present a critique of how their societies are organized, and many of them are
supportive of the way things are.
27.9 CAPITALISM, SOCIALISM AND INEQUALITY
The technological and scientific achievements of the 20th century made possible great
progress and benefits for mankind Possibilities are there for sustaining the entire world
population and for improving the standards of life for all people. Yet globalization and
economies of scale have only widened the gaps between the haves and the have-nots.
Socialist societies, with all their drawbacks, had been able to create more equal
societies, without the huge gaps that we see between the rich and the poor in capitalist countries.
After the collapse of socialism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe the capitalist
states everywhere have unleashed massive cuts in welfare. The consequences have
been disastrous for the majority of the people of this world.
WHAT YOU HA VE LEARNT
In this lesson you would have learnt how the social processes that began in the 19th
century were deepened and accelerated during the 20 th century. Among these were
the demographic changes, the growth of urbanization and changes in city life. The
spread of capitalist industrialization led to the emergence of modern class society all
over the world and changes in family and work patterns. It also gave rise to popular
movements and growth of social and political organizations representing different
sections of society.
Capitalist industrialization creates expansion during the 20th century which made pos-
sible great progress but also led to increasing inequalities in the world.

CULTURAL CHANGE IN THE
TWENTIETH CENTURY

Notes
The twentieth century is often remembered through its landmark events such as the
Bolshevik Revolution, the World Wars, Fascism and the liberation of Asian and Afri-
can nations from colonial rule.
All these developments were undoubtedly crucial and left their deep imprint on the
contemporary world. However, it is important to note that society is transformed not
just by dramatic occurrences but also many slow and long term changes in economy
and culture and demography. The twentieth century was also a period of numerous
such changes some of which were imperceptible to people living through them but
which, in the long run, played a major role in giving to the world its present form.
In the previous chapter you learnt about a number of such developments including
demographic explosion, rapid urbanization and the phenomenal growth of the middle
and the working classes over the past century.

HISTORY
 CULTURAL CHANGE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
Akin to such changes in the social structure or relations between major social groups in
different countries, cultural transformation i.e. changes in people’s values, attitudes,
artistic tastes etc. also came during the same period through a slow and long term
transformation. In the following chapter we shall try to closely examine some of these
cultural changes and also assess whether they are leading to the evolution of a widely
shared global culture today or to more tensions and frictions between cultures. 
OBJECTIVES
After studying this lesson, you will be able to:
• explain the various meanings of the term culture;
• highlight the peculiar features and problems of interpreting culture;
• enumerate the major changes which came about in science, art, religion, educa-
tion, media, recreation and attitudes and values during the twentieth century and
• assess the balance between ‘globalization’ or creation of an integrated world
economy and culture and continuing resistance to western dominance today.
28.1 CULTURE DEFINED
But before we begin our journey into cultural changes of the twentieth century, it
would be useful to carefully examine the various meanings given to the term
culture in different disciplines.
Indeed, culture is one of the most complex terms in social sciences. Not only because
it refers to a wide range of attributes such as customs, habits and values etc. which
are difficult to measure or quantify but also because the term has been used in a
variety of ways by different scholars.
For example, in official announcements and news bulletins, the term culture is fre-
quently used to refer to artistic creations and intellectual achievements primarily.
Thus Indian culture is showcased through our classical and folk music, dance forms,
literature etc. with this usage of the term.
In a sharp departure from this notion, anthropologists use the term culture to refer to
the whole way of life of a community including its cuisine, dress, work and leisure
routines as well as popular customs, festivals etc. In this usage the focus is not so
much on the exclusive or classical achievements of great artists and thinkers but on
everyday practices which have been traditionally shared or accepted in a community.
Thus in the study of Indian culture the focus on our popular festivals, religious tradi-
tions and also the caste system would be important according to this definition.
In yet another interpretation of the term culture, it is the implicit values, beliefs
and attitudes widely shared or understood in a community that are recognized as
the core of any culture. Thus Indian culture is supposed to have traditionally valued
family bonds and respect for elders much more than the western world where
children mostly leave their parents after marriage and the marital bond has also
become extremely fragile.  
In contrast to this concern with mentalities or ideals and belief patterns, archaeologists
prefer to focus on material culture or commonly used artifacts such as pottery, jewelry,
buildings etc. of ancient communities whose remains they try to locate through excavations."

 CULTURAL CHANGE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
If you were to carefully review the preceding definitions you would note that culture
can be studied with two different criteria in mind: of artistic and intellectual refine-
ment on one hand and of historically shared or popular traditions on the other. The
latter can also be identified at different levels: in material objects, practices or in
values and attitudes.
Following these multiple facets of culture, we shall now briefly go through some
outstanding developments in related fields such as the sciences, arts, entertainment,
values, religion and education which were witnessed in the twentieth century.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 28.1
1. Give two example each of revolutionary and slow modes of change witnessed in
the twentieth century.
2. Compare and contrast various interpretations of the term culture. Can you locate
some common features in these interpretations?
3. Why is culture such a difficult term in social sciences?
28.2 SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
Perhaps the most remarkable achievement of the twentieth century was the phenom-
enal growth of science and technology which affected and transformed every aspect
of life from entertainment and education to transport and communication at a very
rapid pace during the period. Cars and aeroplanes, radio and transistors, movies and
television, calculators and computers, satellites and mobile phones and lasers and
organ transplants are only some of the new products and services made available by
modern technology during the preceding century.
Behind this spate of technological innovations lay very intricate developments in vari-
ous scientific realms such as sub atomic physics, genetic and molecular biology and
space research. Some of the famous scientists who made major discoveries in these
fields were Marie Curie, Albert Einstein, Fyneman and Homi J. Bhabha .

HISTORY
 CULTURAL CHANGE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
But by and large recent scientific advancements have not been a product of individual
genius so much as of large teams of scientists drawn from various countries of the
world and concentrated in heavily funded research centers in advanced countries,
specially the USA.
It is also important to note that while contemporary science and technology have
offered numerous benefits to people, at the same time, the apprehension and fear of
science amongst people has also grown simultaneously. Partly this is due to the in-
comprehensibility of latest advances in modern science even to educated laymen.
What makes modern science perhaps even more awesome is its power to manufac-
ture evermore destructive weapons and to threaten the delicate ecological balance on
the earth.
Obviously, social accountability and responsibility of scientists and governments pro-
moting and guiding scientific research is high in the present epoch. 
The Arts and Literature
Besides science, the twentieth century has also been a time of considerable growth
of art forms such as painting, music and literature and of the emergence of some
totally novel artistic media such as cinema and recorded music.
Some of the major art movements which shaped new creative work in this period
across countries were modernism, socialist realism and postmodernism. In fact mod-
ernism evolved as ‘avant garde’ or leading art trend in Europe in the last quarter of
nineteenth century and became a worldwide influence in the twentieth century.
Although modernism had diverse streams such as symbolism, impressionism and sur-
realism, one major tendency common to them all has been the urge to uncover the
deeper world of subconscious feelings and thoughts instead of portraying the appar-
ent world of objects and persons as they appear. Further, to give expression to this
modernist concern with subjective and subconscious elements, conventional modes
of artistic expression had also to be transcended and new and bold experiments tried
repeatedly which often look extremely abstract and incomprehensible to an untrained
viewer.
Some of the great modernists who evolved their own styles in this vein were the
Spanish painter Pablo Picasso famous for introducing ‘cubism’ or multi dimensional
view of figures in paintings and the famous Irish writer James Joyce who introduced
the technique of ‘the stream of consciousness’ in his work called Ulysses.

 CULTURAL CHANGE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
Ironically, while most modernists were extremely bold and experimental in evolving
new modes of artistic expression, in their social and political outlook, many of them
remained apathetic to political challenges of their time and deeply pessimistic about
modern civilization or even the human condition as a whole.
In the same period, however, another branch of artists expressed a more forward
looking and hopeful vision of social transformation in their works through the genre of
socialist realism. Playwrights like Bertold Brecht in Germany and George Bernard
Shaw of Britain and novelists like Maxim Gorki and poets like Alexander Blok in
Russia can be counted as the leading lights of this trend. These poets and writers
were inspired by the ideals of an egalitarian transformation of society.
The Bolshevik Revolution and the creation of the Soviet Union inspired many and
socialist realism as an art trend continued to inspire considerable creative work in
many non communist countries caught in the fierce trap of colonial, feudal and capi-
talist exploitation simultaneously. In India, for example, the Progressive Writers’ As-
sociation was formed by master poets like Majaz and Josh in 1940s with explicit left
sympathies, and other masters such as Premchand reflected deep social concerns in
their realist accounts of rural life of their times. Similarly, in China, great realist writ-
ing with socialist leanings was penned by a genius like Lu Hsun while in Latin America
the anti US resistance inspired the poetry of Pablo Neruda.
In fact, the flowering of art and literature in Asian, African and Latin American
countries in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is one of the most significant
developments of recent times. Artists in such countries gave expression to the
nationalist aspirations on one hand and also dealt with the problem of feudal and
emerging capitalist exploitation within their societies, as also the peculiar chal-
lenge of synthesizing their traditions with a rapid surge of modernization on the
other. From the creative genius of Rabindranath Tagore a hundred years ago to
the post colonial musings of Gabriel Garcia Marquez in Latin America and Chinua
Acebe of Africa, this engagement has produced some of the finest literature of
recent times. 
Philosophy and the Human Sciences
In terms of students, faculty positions in universities and publications, the Human
Sciences (Social Sciences and Psychology) have seen a phenomenal expansion in
the twentieth century and specially after the Second World War in most countries of
the world.
However, along with expansion and the growing race for publications and promotions
amongst social scientists has come a growing tendency for specialization and jargon
which characterizes lots of academic writing today.
In fact, the birth of specialized disciplines from a comprehensive and unspecialized
approach to social and philosophical enquiry can be traced back to early nineteenth
century in Europe when economics, political science, sociology, anthropology and
psychology gradually emerged as distinct disciplines with their own specific methods
and delimited concerns.
Meanwhile, philosophy under the influence of thinkers like A.J. Ayer and Wittgenstein
itself shifted focus increasingly from probing broader questions about ethics and poli-
tics to a narrower and rigorous concern with clarifying the nature of language and
symbols through which issues are posed."

This does not imply that broader questions about causation, human nature and change

28.3 CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS AND SYMBOLS
While changing concerns and achievements of scientists, philosophers and artists are
important aspects of cultural history, changes in cultural institutions such as religions,
folklore, language, education systems and the mass media are also extremely signifi-
cant to note in any study of cultural change. Anthropologists refer to these as cultural
institutions or symbol systems which represent coherent patterns of values and
worldview to the participants. Such cultural symbols are of  historical significance
not only because they address basic human needs for information, entertainment and
faith or ‘meaning’ in life but also because they have a major role in shaping popular
values, beliefs, emotions and behavior patterns commonly observed in different
social groups.

 CULTURAL CHANGE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
But it is important to note here that in most societies, the regulation and control of
cultural institutions such as education and the mass media is mostly in the hands of
the dominant elites who control property as well as centres of power. You are famil-
iar with the Brahmanical influence on Hindu beliefs regarding caste system, sati etc.
which enabled the upper castes especially in ancient India to monopolise the fruits of
labor performed by the Sudras. Similarly, in modern times, the capitalist class exer-
cises vast influence on the mass media and seeks to mould popular beliefs and atti-
tudes in such a way as to facilitate its dominance over the exploited masses with or
without the use of force.   
Within this general model of the operation of cultural institutions, numerous variations
can be seen in their characteristics or ‘meaning’. The past century was indeed a time
of rapid transformation when fundamental changes occurred not only in the message
and content of education, religion and folklore etc. but also in the balance between
these major cultural institutions across countries.
LANGUAGES
One of the principal ingredients of any culture is its language. The twentieth century
witnessed a dramatic transformation of the linguistic map of the world as local dia-
lects spoken by the masses as well as classical languages like Sanskrit and Latin,
which had been the privileged media of learning amongst scholars for centuries, gave
way to select national languages adopted by regions to express their emerging na-
tional identities.
It has been estimated that nearly 6500 languages are still spoken in the world today.
Nearly half of these are spoken by tiny communities and are in the process of be-
coming extinct already. Ten major languages are mother tongues of more than half of
world’s population already. (Source: Foundation for Endangered Languages website)
Another interesting feature of the changing language pattern of the globe in recent
times has been the growth of bilinguism or familiarity with at least two languages
amongst a growing number of educated people across the globe. The English lan-
guage has particularly emerged as the second adopted language with the growth of
globalization and the emergence of the internet. While the Chinese remain the big-
gest linguistic group in the world still, the number of people knowing English (about
10% of global population) is second and the number knowing English as second
language is the highest.
Another major development amongst languages in the twentieth century under the
impact of growing education and mass media has been the growing mixture between
them. While English itself has adopted a number of new words from other languages
including French and Hindi, the evolution of Hinglish or the spoken mixture of Hindi,
Urdu and English amongst educated Indians is also noteworthy in this context.
FOLK TRADITIONS
The twentieth century also saw a major transformation in the position of folklore in
popular culture across societies. Dozens of traditional arts and modes of entertainment
such as puppet shows, story telling, mythological drama, folk dances etc have quietly
but surely got marginalized within the past century over most of the developing world.
Age old songs, tales and fables which had been used by communities to both transmit
ideas and values to succeeding generations rapidly lost ground to professionally pro-
duced entertainment and news programs broadcast through the modern mass media."

HISTORY
 CULTURAL CHANGE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
Yet some effort is being made by states as well as civic agencies, as in India, to
preserve them through financial and institutional support now.
MASS MEDIA
On the other hand radio, cinema, gramophone records, television, cassettes and CDs
and computers and mobile phones arrived in quick succession and revolutionized the
way we receive information, entertain ourselves, relate to each other or even think
and respond to social and political issues.
Though some of the new media like cinema and television have been used for produc-
ing highly artistic and educational programs also by great artists of the century such as
Charlie Chaplin, Satyajit Ray and Steven Spielberg yet, the logic of advertising and the
competition for a mass audience which is the driving force behind these media has
encouraged more and more sensationalism, sex and violence in their programs.
The attention commanded by these new channels of mass communication and enter-
tainment has been historic. Thus it was found during a survey that in the USA a
majority of families already had two TV sets in 1980 and that an average child there
spent twice as much time before television as in study or sports.
RELIGION
Besides traditional art forms and folklore, another major cultural institution whose role in
most societies has got delimited over the past century is religion. In both the developed and
the developing world, predominantly secular outlooks and loyalties such as humanism,
nationalism and democracy have inspired vast movements and commitment amongst
people over the past century. This is not to say that nationalists (who profess a strong
loyalty to a nation state) or the humanists (who value human life more than the after life)
can’t be religious at the same time. Indeed, in almost all the countries, most people (spe-
cially women) continue to count themselves amongst believers to this day. In a 1981
survey of religious beliefs in the USA, for example, only  about 10% of people described
themselves as atheists. Moreover, pilgrimages and the production of devotional literature
and songs etc has actually grown phenomenally over the past century.    
Yet, the shrinking influence of religion in everyday life is also evident in the fact that
religion does not permeate daily practices ranging from greetings, meals, celebra-
tions, public ceremonies etc specially in the cities in the manner it did only a hundred
years back. Secondly, religious values and outlook do not entirely encompass other
major social institutions such as the state, arts etc. as they did earlier and a vast
number of our practices today are actually carried on in a manner quite contradictory
to common religious beliefs. Thus, only a century ago, most marriages even in the
west were solemnized in the church and baptism for every new born was almost
mandatory. By 1990, it was discovered in France that only 30% of couples got mar-
ried in church. Divorce and abortion which were prohibited by the church have be-
come not only legalized in most countries in the west but also increasingly accepted
and destigmatised. Similar trends are visible in many Asian and African countries too.
EDUCATION
While religion has ceased to define, in recent times, the rules and ideals operative in a
growing number of social realms, modern education based on secular and scientific
knowledge has grown phenomenally over the same period. The requirements of modern
educated citizens proficient in reading, writing and calculations and proud of their"

national history and heritage was strongly felt not only for manning the modern posts
in the state and industrial and service sectors of the economy but also for creating a
homogeneous body of citizens intrinsically loyal to their nation states.
Most western countries had made school education compulsory and affordable or
free in the nineteenth century itself. In the previous century, the newly liberated
nations in Asia and Africa also made efforts in the same direction though with less
success due to limited resources and the heavy burden of the colonial and alien
pattern in their education systems. In our country, more than half of the population
remained non literate as late as 1980 and only in the preceding two decades has the
proportion of non literates come down to 25% approximately.
Meanwhile university education expanded rapidly from the middle of the twentieth
century. Thus, in 1939, in advanced countries like Britain and France, less than 0.1%
of the population were enrolled in colleges. By late 1990s, however, nearly 2% of the
population in most of these nations could be receiving college education (a twenty
fold increase). Indeed, between 1960 and 1980, higher education expanded phenom-
enally in the developing world too and similar proportion of students in these poorer
countries got enrolled in universities soon even though their vocational and primary
education still remained undeveloped. Further, due to a much smaller organized sec-
tor in their economies the problem of educated unemployed was also stupendous in
these countries.
University students have been active in social and cultural protests. The large scale and
simultaneous student protests which spread like wild fire from New York and San
Fransisco to Paris and Prague in 1968 are still remembered for their radicalism since
they sought to not only oppose repressive state policies and educational elitism within
these countries, but also spawned robust internationalism and anti war anti imperialist
sentiments by challenging US intervention in Vietnam. In the more recent decades,
however, especially after the fall of the Soviet Union and the proliferation of escapist
entertainment channels, student protests seem to be in a state of lull worldwide.

 CULTURAL CHANGE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
globalization. The process of globalization may be defined as the emergence of a
more and more integrated world with growing networks of multi-national trade, manu-
facturing and finance as well as political and welfare agencies such as the United
Nations and professional bodies such as the World Social Forum uniting an over-
whelming number of people in ties of interdependence though on unequal terms fa-
voring the rich.
The growth of  multi national corporations, the availability of goods and services from
across the globe in city malls and over the internet, cheap and instant communication
of ideas, news and information across the globe, the emergence of global trends and
markets in fashion, food and entertainment are all indications of the extent of global-
ization apparent today.
Here it is important to understand that globalization did not suddenly emerge in the
twentieth century. Global trading networks and flow of medical and technical knowl-
edge can be traced back to earlier periods too. The process of colonization of non
European countries by European powers from the beginning of the sixteenth century
stepped up the unequal integration of the world in a phenomenal way. But the growth
of powerful and far reaching transnational corporations and associations and global
media networks are more specific to the preceding century only.
While these new channels enable global flows of goods, services and information and
may be expected to bring greater choice and possibly prosperity to some regions, the
reality is that not only have they suddenly disrupted age old cultural patterns and social
customs but are also moulding the entire world in western habits and values generally,
besides further sharpening inequalities between the rich and the poor across the globe.
Unfortunately, within this advance of western ideas and habits across the globe again,
the migration of the great ideals of liberty, equality and democracy into the non west-
ern world have been much more difficult than the contagion of western individualism,
materialism, break up of the joint family and community ties, loneliness, neurosis etc.
On top of this, in many developing countries, the problems of rampant poverty, cor-
ruption, criminalization, lawlessness or dictatorships still complicate the situation omi-
nously.
In this scenario, great responsibility falls on the shoulders of the young to make the
right choices between enticing options and steer their countries through the whirlwind
of cultural and social change expected to accelerate in the new century.
WHAT YOU HA VE LEARNT
While leaders, battles and revolutions have a major influence on the world at times,
slow and imperceptible changes in demography, social classes and widely shared
beliefs, values and attitudes also transform it cumulatively.
The twentieth century was a unique time of major changes of the latter type too.
Thus science and technology grew on a phenomenal pace in this period while the arts,
philosophy and literature experienced worldwide movements such as Modernism,
Socialist Realism and Postmodernism, and universal cultural institutions such as lan-
guage, religion, education and mass media saw mammoth quantitative and qualitative
changes in their working."

As a result of these all round and speedy transformations, the world is also becoming
more and more globalised now. This involves increasing integration of most countries
of the world not only in terms of production and consumption of goods and services
but also through exchange of news, information, ideas and entertainment.
While these growing cultural changes offer new opportunities for learning and mobil-
ity to today’s youth, they also pose challenges such as increasing global competition,
rising egoism, consumerism and hedonism and resultant alienation from family, coun-
try and collective efforts for building a just, prosperous and free society.

ANSWERS TO INTEXT QUESTIONS
28.1
1. Examples of Revolutionary Changes of the twentieth century include the birth
of the Soviet Union in 1917 and the independence of colonized nations of Asia
and Africa, led by India from 1947. Illustrations of slow but major cultural changes
of the same period include the spread of literacy and ideas through expansion of
educational institutions as well as mass media and the increasing globalization
of entertainment, news and knowledge production.
2. The term culture has been used in two different ways by social scientists: to refer
to creative work in the arts, literature, philosophy etc and to denote common val-
ues, beliefs and behavior patterns of a community deriving from its shared history,
physical environment and traditions of language, folklore etc. While the former
notion of culture is often exclusive to highly talented minds the latter pertains to
social groups as a whole. Both, however, speak of mental phenomena mainly.
3. The term culture is as difficult as it is important in social sciences because its
usage varies across thinkers and also because it refers to phenomena which are
neither concrete nor measurable.

Evolution of State in India
TOWARDS THE FORMATION OF THE
STATE
29
Notes
The state is a term we often take for granted. What exactly do we mean by it?
Usually, we associate the state with certain forms of government. These could be
monarchies or republics, or in some instances, oligarchis. i.e. the rule of few. These
distinctions rest on the way power, i.e. the ability to influence and control the lies of
people, is either concentrated in the hands of a few or shared amongst many.
Those who control states, whom we identify as rulers, regulate political relations, and
function through a variety of institutions. These include administrative services, used
for a range of functions such as revenue collection, the army, and judiciary. Rulers
also try to convince people that the form of government that they head is ideal. In
other words, they try to legitimize the existence of the state.
States have developed over a long period of time, and in different ways. In this lesson
we will explore some of the earliest trends in the subcontinent.
OBJECTIVES
After studying this lesson you will be able to:
• distinguish between chiefdoms and kingdoms;
• explain the feature of early kingdoms and
• understand how some of these early kingdoms became powerful states.
29.1 THE BACKGROUND
In earlier lessons you may have studied about the Harappan civilization. This was a
very well-developed civilization, with large cities, where people produced a wide
variety of things. Some scholars have suggested that there must have been a state
organization in the Harappan civilization. This is very likely, but we do not have the
evidence to figure out what kind of state this was, and we do not have details about
administrative institutions.
(i) Chiefdoms in Early Vedic Literature
You have read about the Rigveda in earlier lessons (lesson 4). The Rigveda was
probably composed between 1800-1000 BC. This is a collection of hymns addressed
to various gods, in particular to Agni, Indra and Soma. Generally, the hymns were"
dgx\sr. secondary history.pdf,"2 HISTORY
        MODULE - 6A
Evolution of State in India
Notes
 TOWARDS THE FORMATION OF THE STATE
composed by members of priestly families. They were usually chanted when sacrifices
were performed, and were used to invite the gods to the rituals. Most of the hymns were
composed in north – west India, in the region drained by the Indus and its tributaries.
The hymns also contain other information. They include lists of things for which
people prayed. And they occasionally give us the names of chiefs or important men of
those times.
Do the hymns provide us the information about the political processes? Well, the
answer is a qualified yes. The hymns do not provide us with direct information about
political events (expect in some rare instances). At the same time, the contents of the
hymns can be analyzed to understand how political relations were organized.
(ii) Rajas with a difference
Generally, when we use the term raja we have an idea that this is a man who lives in
a palace, has a large number of servants under his command, is extremely rich, is the
head of a large army, and has a court. And we usually think of rajas passing down
their power to their sons. Preferably the eldest son. Yet, the term raja did not always
have this meaning.
In the Rigveda, the term raja is used as an adjective for a number of gods. It is also
occasionally used to describe powerful men. These men did no control a vast army or
a large administrative system. Their main source of power was probably derived
from leadership in warfare. Let us see why battles were fought, and what happened
after that.
29.1.4 Battles
You may remember that the Rigveda indicates that people at that time were primarily
farmers. So we find that some battles were fought to acquire pasture land. Usually,
the best pasture lands were along rivers. Battles were also fought for water for both
people and animals, to capture cattle and land, especially for pasture, and for growing
hardy crops that ripened quickly, such as barley. Besides, battles were fought to
capture women.
Most men took part in these wars. There was no regular army, but there were assem-
blies where people met and discussed matters of war and peace. They also choose
leaders, brave and skillful warriors. Sometimes, they performed special sacrifices
and prayed to the gods for success in battle.
What happned if the raja led his people to victory? Lands that were won or water
sources to which access was gained were probably held and used in common. Other
things, such as cattle and women, were probably distributed amongst the raja’s sup-
porters. Some of these were given to priests, who performed sacrifices both to pray
for the victory of the raja as well as to thank the gods for supporting their ruler when
he was victorious.
Who did they fight with? The Rigveda contains the names of a number of tribes. These
include the Purus, Yadus, Bharatas, Anus, and Druhus. Sometime these tribes united
with one another, but they also fought with one another. Sometimes, these people, who
called themselves Aryas, fought with others, whom they called Dasas or Dasyus.
We find two terms being used for the common people. One is the word jana, which is
often used in Hindi and other languages even today. The other is the term vis. Usually,"

HISTORY
 TOWARDS THE FORMATION OF THE STATE
the raja is referred to as the raja of a jana or a vis. In other words, the raja was not
regarded as the raja of a kingdom or a fixed territory, but of a group of people.
As we have seen, these rajas are not quite like those we are familiar with. They have
often been regarded as chiefs rather than kings, and the realm over which they exer-
cised control has been defined as a chiefdom rather than as a kingdom.
• Chiefs are usually chosen by the people, either directly or indirectly, whereas
kings are hereditary.
• Chiefs usually do not have any permanent administrative mechanism to support
them: they depend on the support of kinsfolk and other followers. While kings
may also depend on their relatives for support, they have additionally, an admin-
istrative system to depend on.
• Chiefs do not collect regular taxes: instead, they often depend on gifts that may
be brought in by their followings. Kings may receive gifts, but their major source
of revenue is usually derived from tax collection.
• Chiefs do not maintain standing armies: they depend on militia, i.e. people who
are called upon to fight as and when necessary, and who are not paid regular
salaries. Kings may continue to recruit people as militia, but usually also maintain
standing armies.
• Generally, chiefs interact with peple in assemblies, where people can express
their opinions on important matters. Kings also participate in assemblies, but
these tend to be more formal occasions.

29.2 THE EARLIEST KINGDOMS: JANAPADAS
Between about 1000 BC and 500 BC, certain important developments took place in
north India. We now find a growth in the number of settlements, often associated
with the Painted Grey Ware culture about which you have learnt in lesson five. Amongst
other things, settled agriculture became more important, there was a growth in
population, and iron was increasingly used to make tools and weapons.
We also have a very elaborate set of texts, which we refer to as the later Vedic
literature. These texts deal with rituals, explaining them, analyzing them, and de-
scribing how they were to be performed incidentally, they suggest that a new form
of political organization that is often referred as the janapada was now becoming
more important."

 TOWARDS THE FORMATION OF THE STATE
As is obvious, the term janapada was derived from the word jana, which, as we have
seen, referred to people. In fact, janapada means where the jana places its feet and
settles down. The land was now named after them. For example, the land where the
Kurus settled down was known as Kuru janapada.
Another distinctive feature of the janapadas was that the population living in these
territories was often classified according to varna, the four fold social classification
about which you learnt in lesson four.
29.3 NEW WAYS OF BECOMING OF RAJA
The leader or chief of the janapada continued to be called a raja. But there were
important wasys in which this raja was different from that of the jana. To start with, we
have indications that in some cases at least, the position of the raja was now hereditary.
In other words, sons inherited or could legitimately claim the kingdom of their fathers.
Secondly, we now find mention of elaborate rituals, of which the rajasuya and the
asvamedha are the most well known. These were ling, sometimes lasting for more
than a year. Only specially trained priests could perform them. The priests who com-
posed and compiled Vedic literature now stated that whoever was capable of per-
forming these elaborate rituals would be recognized as king.
Many people were expected to take part in such sacrifices. These included the raja.
This was major occasion for declaring his power. His family, especially his wives and
sons, had to help him in the sacrifices. His other supporters, including the chariot driver,
family priest, (purohita), head of the army, messengers also joined in. The common
people, the vis or vaishya, were expected to bring gifts for the raja, which provided
much of the wealth needed to perform the sacrifice. Neighbouring rajas were often
invited to watch the spectacle. And of course priests conducted the entire ritual.
Could shudras take part in the rituals? Sometimes they were given small roles in the
rituals, but very often they were excluded from them. Even those who participated
could only play their own parts. For example, the vaishya could not act as priest, nor
could the raja’s wife take his place.
What did these rituals entail? In the case of the asvamedha or the horse sacrifice, the
sacrificial horse was let loose to wander for a year, accompanied by a group of armed
men. All those who allowed the horse to pass through tacitly acknowledged the
authority of the owner of the horse.
When the horse was brought back, it was sacrificed in an elaborate ritual. Large
numbers of people, including other rulers, priests, and common people, were invited to
participate in and/or witness the event. There was feasting and story–telling as well.
In other words, this was an enormous, expensive ceremony.
Any aspiring ruler who wanted to perform such a ritual had to be both powerful and
wealthy. The priests were rewarded with large sacrificial fees or daksina. These
could include horses, cattle, gold and silver objects, chariots, cloths, and slave men
and women, amongst other things. Thus, by performing the ritual successfully, the
raja was able to make a public announcement, as well as a display of this power.
Many of these rituals included an abhiseka. This meant a sprinkling of the ruler with
purified, holy water. Usually, the first sprinkling was done by the priest, though others,
such as the vaisya and the ruler’s relatives, could also participate in the process."

HISTORY
 TOWARDS THE FORMATION OF THE STATE
As you can see, there was now no question of popular assembly choosing a raja. A
man could become a raja if he was born into a ruling family, or try to become one if he
had adequate military and material resources.
29.4 THE BEGINNINGS OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM
One of the rituals frequently described in later Vedic text in the rajasuya. If you are
familiar with the story of the Mahabharat, you may remember that the rajasuya was
an important sacrifice that was performed by Udhisthira in order to claim the throne.
As part of the rajasuya, there is mention of a ritual known as he ratninam havimsi.
This is a ritual in which the raja was expected to make offerings in the homes of
important people, referred to as ratnins, (literally those who possessed jewels). These
important people included the wives of the ruler, the leader of the army, the chief
priest, the charioteer, and some other, including messengers and those who collected
or received gifts on behalf of the ruler.
There is no mention of regular salaries being paid to these “officials.” However, given
their functions, we can suggest that some of them perhaps formed the nucleus from
which later administrative system developed.
29.5 RESOURCES FOR THE RAJA
Although the raja who rules over the janapada was in many ways different from the
raja as described in the Regveda, he shared certain features with him as well. We
find that even during this period, the main ways in which the raja could acquire re-
sources was through battle, and through gifts.
These gifts, often referred to as bali, could be demanded on rituals occasions. For
examples, if the raja was performing an asvamedha, he could demand resources
from his people. While the term “gift” suggests a voluntary offering. People could be
persuaded and perhaps even forced to make gifts.
We find that the texts use certain new analogies to describe the relationship between
the raja and his people. The raja is described as the cater, or the deer and the people
as the food or the fodder. This does suggest that people were occasionally exploited
even though regular taxes were not demanded.
At the same time, people may have made offering to the raja in order to win his support,
and to ensure that he was both able and willing to protect them from other rulers.
Another similarity between the raja of the Rigveda and the raja of the later Vedic
tradition was the dependence on a militia for armed support. Can you think about why
the ruler may not have been able to maintain a standing army?
29.6 MAHAJANAPADAS
By about 500 BC, some janapadas became more powerful than the others and were
now known as mahajanpadas. Buddhist and Jaina text provide us with lists of 16
mahajanapadas. The more important amongst these, as well as their capital cities, are
shown on the map. (please see table no. 5.1 in Book 1 p 67 and map on 68)
For janapadas were particularly important. These were those of Kosala, Avanti, Vajji, and
Magadha. Of these, ultimately Magadha became the most powerful janapada. The Mauryan
empire, the first known empire in the history of the subcontinent, had its centre in Magadha."

        MODULE - 6A
Evolution of State in India
Notes
 TOWARDS THE FORMATION OF THE STATE
The mahajanapadas differed from the janapadas in a ways. Let us look at some of
these differences.
29.7 FORTIFIED CITIES
Almost all the mahajanpads had a capital city. Unlike the settlements in the janapadas
many of these were fortified. This means that huge walls of wood, brick or stone
were build around them.
We have some idea of the people who lived in these cities. These included the rulers
and their supporters, and other such as craftsmen, merchants, traders, and small shop
keepers. Some of the people who lived in such cities were wealthy men and women.
Many of the cities that we know today developed during this period. These include
cities like Mathura, Varanasi, Vaishali and Pataliputra. These cities were sustained by
developments in agriculture, where, with the use of the iron tools, it now became
possible to produce more food.
Forts were probably built because some of the people who lived in cities were afraid
of attacks and needed protection. It is also likely that some rulers wanted to show
how rich and powerful they were building really large, tall, impressive walls around
their cities.
Building such huge walls required a great deal of planning. Thousands, if not lakh of
bricks of stone had to be prepared. This in turn meant enormous labour, provided,
possible, by thousands of men, women and children. And of course, money had to be
found to pay for all of this.
29.8 NEW ARMIES
By about 330 BC, we have evidence to suggest that the armies in some of these
mahajanpadas were organized differently. This was the time when Alexander, a ruler
of Macadonia, to the north of Greece, decided to embark on an expedition to conquer
the world. As may be expected, he did not conquer the world. However, he con-
quered part of Egypt, West Asia and came to the Indian subcontinent, reaching up to
the banks of the Beas.
When he wanted to move further eastwards, his soldiers refused. They were scared
as they had heard that the rulers of India had vast armies of foot soldiers, chariots and
elephants.
These armies were very different from the ones mentioned earlier. Soldiers in the
new army were paid regular salaries and maintained by the king throughout the year.
We also find elephants being used on a large scale. If we remember that elephants
are difficult to capture, tame and train, it becomes evident that now armies have
become far more elaborate and well organized than before. And maintaining such
large armies would have required far more resources than what was needed for the
simple armies of the janapadas.
We learn from Buddhist texts that the rulers of Magadha build up on the best armies.
They used elephants found in the forests within the state. They also used iron from
the mines within their kingdom. This provided the army with strong weapons.
A well-equipped army, led by ambitious rulers, meant that the ruler of Magadha could
soon overcome most other rulers, and expand control over neighbouring areas. In"

29.9 REGULAR TAXES
As the rulers of the mahajanapadas were building huge forts  maintaining big armies,
they needed a regular supply of money. So collecting taxes became very important.
• Taxes on crops were the most important. This was because most people were
farmers. They often depended on the ruler for protection of their land and crops.
Usually, the tax fixed at 1/6 th of what was produced on the land. This tax was
known as bhaga.
• There were taxes on craft as well. These were usually in the form of labour. So,
for example, a weaver or a smith had to work for a day every month for the
government. Herders were also expected to pay taxes.
• There were also taxes on goods that were bought and sold, through trade.
And of course the king needed many officials to collect taxes and more money to pay
their salaries.
Some taxes were collected in the form of goods, such as grain, and cattle, or things
produced by craftsmen. Sometimes taxes were collected in cash. In fact, some of the
earlier coins belong to this period.
29.10 MAGADHA AND ITS RULERS
Magadha became the most important mahajanapada in about two hundred years.
This was partly because of the Magadhan army (see above).
Besides, Magadha was surrounded by rivers, included the Ganga and Son. This was
important for transport, water supplies and fertile land.
Magadha had two very powerful rulers, Bimbisara and his son Ajatashatrum who use
all possible means to overcome their rivals and conquer other janapadas. Sometimes,
they entered into marriage alliances with neighbouring rulers. In other instances, they
led armies into and actually conquered neighbouring states."

Notes
 TOWARDS THE FORMATION OF THE STATE
Mahapadma Nada was another important ruler or Magadha. He extended his control
up to the northwest part of the subcontinent. It is likely that Alexander’s soldiers had
heard about his vast army.
We do not hear of the rulers of Magadha performing large-scale sacrifices. Can you
think of any reasons why they would not have performed these elaborate rituals?
29.11 GANA  SANGHAS
While many mahajanapada were ruled by individuals rajas, some were under a differ-
ent form of government, and were known as gana sanghas. Here there were not one,
but many rulers. Interestingly, sometimes even when thousands of men ruled to-
gether, each one was known as a raja.
These rajas performed rituals together. These rituals were not like the Vedic sacri-
fices. They also met in assemblies, and decided what had to be done and how, through
discussion and debate. For examples, if they were attacked by enemy, they met in
their assembly to discuss what should be done to meet the threat. And instead of
standing armies, we find that the rajas all joined together, with their followers, to form
an army as and when required.
All the land of the gana sanghas was owned by all the rajas together (jointly). They
usually got slaves and labourers known as dasa karmakaras to cultivate the land.
These men and women were given some food, clothing and shelter, but everything
else they produced was taken by the rajas and there relatives.
Some of the most well known gana sanghas were those of the Mallas and the Vajjis.
The Vajji gana sangha was regarding as a mahajanapada, with famous city of Vaishali
as its capital. Both the Buddha and Mahavira belonged to gana sanghas. Some of the
most vivid descriptions of life in the gana sanghas can be found in Buddhist books.
So, as you can see, not all mahajanapadas had an identical form of government.

HISTORY
 TOWARDS THE FORMATION OF THE STATE
WHAT YOU HA VE LEARNT
The formation of the state can be traced to Early Vedic Period where the chiefdoms
gradually gave way to formation of kingdom as a result of battle for pasture land.
The battles fought used a range from fight among tribes or a group of tribes fighting
against other group tribes.  The early kingdom called as Janapadas gradually gave
way to Mahajanapads characterized by stone walled fojet, large number of servants,
huge armies. There were different ways in which the raja or chief was different from
the common people called janas.
Gradually the position of the raja became hereditary. He had a large army which
required huge expenses to maintain it. These were met through taxes on crops, taxes
on craft and goods.
An interesting concept was that of Gana Sanghas meaning rule of many rulers, each
called a raja. These rajas performed rituals together. They met in assemblies and decided
what had to be done? The land of the gana samaghas was owned by all the rajas jointly.

 EARLY  STATES

Notes
In the history of ancient India we may come across many forms of society ranging
from urban civilization of Indus Valley to the Classical Age of Gupta Dynasty.  During
this period we see a hierarchy of centralized and decentralized governments, some of
which were highly organized in their political structure and government while others
were merely weakened by internal problems and division of power.
OBJECTIVES
After studying this lesson, you will be able to:
• explain as to how the state system developed in early India;
• distinguish between various kinds of states and
• understand how most powerful states emerged.
30.1 BACKGROUND
In the beginning human society had the belief that all human beings are equal and
should have same rights, as it was basically a tribal society. Emergence of idea of
state was a result of conflicts over control of resources and development of a differ-
entiated economy or the society arranged itself at separate levels. Development of a
class based society was an essential pre- requisite for changing the state system.
Growth of population and development of sedentary life were the other factors.
30.2 GROWTH OF IDEA OF KINGSHIP
The archeological evidences uncovered a strong centralized authority in Harappa. In
the Vedic monarchies, the clan -chief became the king and was gradually invested
with a status i.e equal to being god. Buddhist and Jaina thought ignored the idea of
divinity and assumed instead that, in the original state of nature, all needs were effort-
lessly provided but that slowly a decline set in and man became evil, developing
desires, which led to the notions of private property and of family and finally to im-
moral behaviour. In this condition of chaos, the people gathered together and decided
to elect one among them (the mahasammata, or “great elect”) in whom they would
invest authority to maintain law and order. Thus, gradually the institution of the state
came into being. Later theories retained the element of a contract between the ruler
and the people. Brahmanic sources held that the gods appointed the ruler and that a"

MODULE - 6A

Notes
 EARLY STATES
contract of dues was concluded between the ruler and the people. Also prevalent
was the theory of matsyanyaya, which proposes that in periods of chaos, when there
is no ruler, the strong devour the weak, just as in periods of drought, big fish eat little
fish. Thus, the need for a ruler was viewed as absolute. The existence of the state
was primarily dependent on two factors: danda (authority) and dharma (in its sense
of the social order i.e., the preservation of the caste structure). The Artha-sastra,
moreover, refers to the seven limbs (saptanga) of the state as the king, administra-
tion, territory, to capital, treasury, forceful authority, and allies. However, the impor-
tance of the political notion of the state gradually began to fade, partly because of a
decline of the political tradition of the republics and the proportional dominance of the
monarchical system, in which loyalty was directed to the king. The emergence of the
Mauryan Empire strengthened the political notion of monarchy. The second factor
was that the dharma, in the sense of the social order, demanded a far greater loyalty
than did the rather blurred idea of the state. The king’s duty was to protect dharma,
and, as long as the social order remained intact, anarchy would not prevail. Loyalty to
the social order, which was a fundamental aspect of Indian civilization, largely ac-
counts for the impressive continuity of the major social institutions over many centu-
ries. However, it also shifted loyalty from the political notion of the state, which might
otherwise have permitted more frequent empires and a greater political conscious-
ness. After the decline of the Mauryas, the re- emergence of an empire was to take
many centuries.
30.3 INDUS AND VEDIC POLITICAL / OR GOVERNMENTAL
          ORGANISATIONS: PRE–STATE TO STATE
The urban civilization of Indus Valley suggests a complex planning that undertook the
region and the people lived up to the standard of the time. Despite a growing body of
archaeological evidence, the social and political structures of the Indus “state” re-
main objects of guess work. The remarkable uniformity of weights and measures
throughout the Indus lands, as well as the development of such presumably civic
works as the great granaries, implies a strong degree of political and administrative
control over a wide area.
The Aryans are said to have entered India through the fabled Khyber Pass, around
1500 BC and gave rise to another civilization in Indian history, the Vedic period. The
Aryans were divided into tribes, which had settled in different regions of northwest-
ern India. Tribal chieftainship gradually became hereditary, though the chief usually
operated with the help of advice from either a committee or the entire tribe. Tribal
chiefs bearing the title Raja or king were at first little more than war-lords, and their
principal duty was protection of their tribes. The power of the king positioned with the
higher authority of the priests. Vedic kingship was the natural outcome of the condi-
tions surrounding the Aryans. A king was the leader of the people in the war of
attacking action and defense. He is called the “Protector of the people”. A study of
the Rigveda shows that the king was no longer merely a leader of a primitive tribe, but
occupied a position of preeminence among the people.  The protection of the people
was the sacred duty of the king.  In return, he expected and received loyal obedience
from his subjects in the sense of a tribute to the king.
The Aryan tribes failed to unite against non-Aryans due to lack of strong political
foundation and the unstable nature due to their internal caste system.  The weak
character of the empire came from the rigid caste system that divided people and"

created unstable feelings among them. These were some of the reasons due to which
the Vedic empire was far less organized than the Indus Valley Civilization.
To begin with, during Vedic age there existed political units like jana which later
became janapada – mahajanapada. A jana was a region where lived the people
of the tribe. These tribes were named after a particular chieftain. Later, with the
extension of territory, there was a change in the nature of political organization.
Statecraft art of government evolved as a new system of government following the
Vedic period. The solidarity of the tribal state and the political power of best warriors
gave rise to a new style of kingship. It aimed at the creation of more professional
armies and more dependent upon the king. The statecraft aimed at acquisition of
territories rich in natural resources and tax-paying peasants rather than booty or
territory for tribal expansion.
30.4 MAHAJANPADAS
The centuries before the establishment of the Mauryan Empire – the period which
was the development of the Kosala and Magadha kingdoms – were a period of
relatively rapid social and economic change. We find the breaking into small pieces of
tribal polities, the development of the caste model and the move to the rice lands of
the Eastern Gangetic Valley. In times of the disintegration of old social ties, during the
establishment of new ways of being in social and political relationships, we find idea
based on great change. The emergence of Buddhism and Jainism was a result of this
upheaval. From their original settlements in the Punjab region, the Aryans gradually
began to penetrate eastward, clearing dense forests and establishing “tribal” settle-
ments along the Ganga and Yamuna (Jamuna) plains between 1500 and ca. 800 B.C.
By around 500 B.C., most of northern India was inhabited and had been brought
under cultivation, facilitating the increasing knowledge of the use of iron implements,
including ox-drawn ploughs, and spurred by the growing population that provided
voluntary and forced labor. As river based and inland trade flourished, many towns
along the Ganga became centers of trade, culture, and luxurious living. Increasing
population and surplus production provided the bases for the emergence of indepen-
dent states with fluid territorial boundaries over which disputes frequently arose.
The basic administrative system headed by tribal chieftains was transformed by a
number of regional republics or hereditary monarchies that devised ways to appropri-
ate revenue and to conscript labor for expanding the areas of settlement and
agriculture farther east and south, beyond the Narmada River. These emergent states
collected revenue through officials, maintained armies, and built new cities and high-
ways. By 600 B.C., sixteen such territorial powers stretched across the North India
plains from modern-day Afghanistan to Bangladesh. The right of a king to his throne,
no matter how it was gained, was usually made lawful through elaborate sacrifice
rituals and genealogies i.e history of members of a family from past to present
concocted by priests who ascribed to the king divine or superhuman origins. In the
texts we find references to the emergence of sixteen mahajanapadas. Important
among them were Magadha, Kosala, Kasi, Avanti, Vaishali, Lichhavi, etc.
Mahajanapadas were of two kinds, as discussed below :
(i) Monarchical Mahajanpadas
First, there existed monarchical types, where the king or chieftain was the head of the
territory. In this type, the Vedic ceremonies and brahmanas were given much"

importance. The kings performed vedic sacrifices in these regions. For instance, Kosala
belonged to the category of monarchical mahajanapada. Prasenajit, the king of Kosala
was known to have performed several sacrifices.
(ii) Republican Mahajanpadas
The second type among mahajanapadas was republican or oligarchic which differed
from the monarchical states. In this second category, the king was selected from the
group of people called rajas. There is reference to assemblies called sabha where
the members used to have discussions regarding a particular matter, then the item
was put to vote.
In one such assembly there is reference to the existence of 7707 rajas who repre-
sented the class of rajanyas who owned land that was cultivated by dasa, karmakaras
or labourers. The rajas were known for their ability to fight. In this category, Vedic
sacrifices were not given much importance and the brahmanas were given number
two social status after the kshatriyas. The main source for the study of these
mahajanapadas is the Buddhist texts.
(iii) Conflict between Monarchical Mahajanpadas and Republican
          Mahajanpadas
The Vrijji confederacy (union of several states) near the foot of Himalayas was a
powerful oligarchy, which challenged the supremacy of some monarchical states.
Monarchical states like Magadha and Lichhavi were in a great state of difficult choice
as they were not able to extend their territories. Among the mahajanapadas, there
emerged conflict for power and supremacy. Magadha had an ambitious king called
Ajatasatru, who decided to conquer the neighboring regions. Due to warfare and
marriage alliances he was able to conquer Kosala and Kasi.

differences among the tribes of Vrijji confederacy. Due to this effort, ultimately Ajatasatru
obtained success against Lichhavi which became part of Magadha empire.
This region controlled the northern trade route called uttarapatha, while the south-
erly route called dakshinapatha was under the control of Magadha. Due to these
conquests, Magadha was able to manage economic resources like fertile river valleys
and iron ore mines which provided the necessary supply of materials for the produc-
tion of different goods. As a result it was in Magadha that we find the beginning of
signs of state formation.
The Mauryan Empire, ruled by the Mauryan dynasty, was the largest and most pow-
erful political and military empire of ancient India. Originating from the kingdom of
Magadha in the Indo-Gangetic plains of modern Bihar and Bengal and with its capital
city of Pataliputra (near modern Patna), the Empire was founded in 322 BC by
Chandragupta Maurya, who had overthrown the Nanda Dynasty and begun expand-
ing his power across central and western India . The Empire was expanded into
India’s central and southern regions by Emperor Bindusara, but it excluded a small
portion of unexplored tribal and forested regions near Kalinga.
Following the conquest of Kalinga in a major war, Ashoka the Great ended the military
expansion of the empire. The kingdoms of Pandya and Cheras in southern India thus
preserved their independence, accepting the supremacy of the Mauryan emperor. The
Mauryan Empire was perhaps the greatest empire to rule the Indian subcontinent until
the arrival of the British. Its decline began fifty years after Ashoka’s rule ended, and it
dissolved in 185 BC with the foundation of the Sunga Dynasty in Magadha.
30.6 THE MAURYAN STATE
Chandragupta’s minister Kautilya Chanakya wrote the Arthashastra, one of the great-
est treatises on economics, politics, foreign affairs, administration, military arts, war,
and religion ever produced in the East. Archaeologically, the period of Mauryan rule
in South Asia falls into the era of Northern Black Polished Ware (NBPW). The
Arthashastra and the Edicts of Ashoka are primary sources of written records of the
Mauryan times. The Lion Capital of Asoka  at Sarnath, is the emblem of India.
The Mauryan Empire consisted of a great variety of political formations and ecological
zones: it contained forest peoples and nomads, chieftaincies and oligarchies like the
gana– sangha confederacies of chiefs. It contained smaller kingdoms with a range of
administrative structures not necessarily similar to that in Magadha. Different parts of
the empire like the core, the metropolis and the peripheries were administered in differ-
ent ways. Thus there did not exist a uniform method of administration in the whole of
Mauryan Empire. While the core and the metropolis were directly administered by the
state; the periphery region was given more autonomy as more importance was given to
the collection of taxes and tributes from these regions. The administrative network
consisted of an upper bureaucracy recruited from the upper castes and receiving hand-
some salaries. There was no central method of recruitment and local persons appear to
have been appointed in areas distant from the metropolitan state.
During the rule of Ashoka the Mauryan Empire was organized formally into five
parts. Magadha and some adjacent mahajanapadas were under direct administration.
There is evidence from the reports of Megasthenes, a Greek ambassador, and from
the Arthasastra, of relatively centralized administration in the centre part."

 EARLY STATES
30.7 THE MAURYAN BUREAUCRACY
The Empire was divided into four provinces, with the royal capital at Pataliputra.
From Ashokan edicts, the names of the four provincial capitals are Tosali (in the
east), Ujjain (in the west), Suvarnagiri (in the south), and Taxila (in the north). The
head of the provincial administration was the Kumara (royal prince), who gov-
erned the provinces as king’s representative. The kumara  was assisted by
mahamatyas and council of ministers. This organizational structure was reflected
at the imperial level with the Emperor and his Mantriparishad  (Council of Minis-
ters). The bureaucracy was not required to restructure conquered areas to con-
form to auniform pattern but to ensure the flow of revenue. At the peak period of
the empire, mention is made of a group of officers, basically concerned with rev-
enue administration, who appear to have been centrally appointed and who were
required to tour the areas under their jurisdiction and enquire into the well-being of
the subjects. Irrigation was considerably decentralized, frequently in small-scale
systems drawing water from rivers, pools, wells, springs and artificial ponds called
tanks. More elaborate reservoirs and river banks were built with local resources,
though the empire assisted irrigation works in newly settled lands. Evidence sug-
gests that irrigation works were locally controlled.
The Mauryans appear to have had interest in gaining revenue from trade. They did
not, here, either, however, take an active role in the regulation of trade. This is indi-
cated by the fact that they appear not to have issued metallic money of a distinctive
kind. The modest punch-marked coins which have been found may very well have
been issued by guilds or other local bodies. The state attempted to maintain control
over individual traders and guilds, inspecting their identity, their merchandise and their
profits. The sale of goods at the place of production was not permitted, presumably
because sale in markets was more accessible to revenue collectors. The state
collected a series of taxes at various points in the production of goods from raw
materials to commodities. Special officers were appointed to ensure standards and
prevent fraud as well as to intercept trade in those items which the state had a
monopoly such as, weapons, armor, metals, and gems. Commodity production was
therefore an independent enterprise geared to a market and trade was a major
revenue resource for the state.
Historians theorize that the organization of the empire was in line with the extensive
bureaucracy described by Kautilya in the Arthashastra: a sophisticated civil service
governed everything from municipal hygiene to international trade. The expansion
and defence of the empire was made possible by what appears to have been the
largest standing army of its time. According to Megasthenes, the possessed wielded
a military of 600,000 infantry, 30,000 cavalry, and 9,000 war elephants. A vast
espionage system collected intelligence for both internal and external security
purposes. Having renounced offensive warfare and expansionism, Ashoka neverthe-
less continued to maintain this large army, to protect the Empire and instill stability and
peace across West and South Asia.
30.8 POST MAURYAN STATES
Post Mauryan polity was marked by the arrival of central Asian conquerors i.e. the
Indo- Greeks, the Sakas, the Parthians and the Kushanas. They imposed their rule on
native princes which paved the way for development of an organization based on
relationship of a master and servant. The central Asians strengthened the idea of"

30.9 EXPANSION OF THE GUPTA STATE
The greatest empire in the fourth century AD was the Gupta Empire, which ushered
in the golden age of Indian history. This empire lasted for more than two centuries. It
covered a large part of the Indian subcontinent, but its administration was more de-
centralized than that of the Mauryas, but more centralized than Sungas.  The theory
of the divinity of kings became more popular during the Gupta period. Alternately
waging war and entering into matrimonial alliances with the smaller kingdoms in its
neighborhood, the empire’s boundaries kept fluctuating with each ruler. The Gupta
realm, although less extensive than that of the Mauryas, did encompass the northern
half and central parts of the subcontinent. The Gupta period also has been called an
Imperial Age, but the administrative centralization so characteristic of an imperial
system is less apparent than during the Mauryan period. The Guptas tended to allow
kings to remain as serving in a slave like manner; unlike the Mauryas, they did not
consolidate every kingdom into a single administrative unit. This would be the model
for later Mughal rule and British rule built off of the Mughal paradigm.
The Guptas, a comparatively unknown family, came from either Magadha or eastern
Uttar Pradesh. The third king, Chandra Gupta I (Chandragupta I), took the title of
maharajadhiraja. He married a Lichhavi princess- an event celebrated in a series
of gold coins. It has been suggested that, if the Guptas ruled in Prayaga (modern
Allahabad in eastern Uttar Pradesh), the marriage alliance may have added Magadha
to their domain. The Gupta era began in 320 BC. Chandra Gupta appointed his son
Samudra Gupta to succeed him about 330 BC, according to a long eulogy to Samudra
Gupta inscribed on a pillar at Allahabad. The coins of an obscure prince, Kacha,
suggest that there may have been contenders for the throne. Samudra Gupta’s
campaigns took him in various directions and resulted in many conquests. Among
those he rendered were willing to do what others want. They belonged to the rulers of
Aryavarta, various forest chiefs, the northern oligarchies, and border States in the"

east, in addition to Nepal. More distant domains brought within Samudra Gupta’s orbit
were regarded as subordinate; these comprised the “king of kings” of the northwest,
the Sakas, the Murundas, and the inhabitants of “all the islands”, including Sinhala
(Sri Lanka), all of which are listed in the inscription at Allahabad. The Ganges Valley
and central India were the areas under direct administrative control. Samudra Gupta
was succeeded about 380 BC by his son Chandra Gupta II, though there is some
evidence that there may have been an intermediate ruler Ram Gupta. Chandra Gupta
II’s major campaign was against the Saka rulers of Ujjain, the success of which was
celebrated in a series of silver coins. Gupta territory adjoining the northern Deccan
was secured through a marriage alliance with the Vakataka dynasty, the successors
of the Satavahanas in the area. Although Chandra Gupta II took the title of
Vikramaditya (Sun of Valour), his reign is associated more with cultural and intellec-
tual achievements than with military campaigns. His Chinese contemporary, Fa-hsien,
a Buddhist monk, traveled in India and left an account of his impressions.
30.10 NATURE OF THE GUPTA STATE
From the reign of Chandragupta I onwards the Guptas took the title of Maharajadhiraj
as is known from inscriptions are  Paramarajadhiraja , Rajadhirajashri ,
Rajarajadhiraja. In the Allahabad pillar inscription, Samudragupta is regarded as
God living on earth. In the historical accounts he is referred to as Kuber, Indra etc.
Hereditary succession was established in this period though the emperor chose the
heir apparent. Several powers conquered by the Guptas were allowed to function
independently. They were subjugated conquered but not incorporated in the empire.
These feudatories (servant like) paid tribute to the Guptas but at times some of them
did not mention Guptas as their suzerain (controller of records) in their official records.
The practice of land grants and also grants of villages under the Satvahanas contin-
ued under the Guptas. These grants carried with them administrative rights which led
to the decentralization of administrative authority. Rights of subinfeudation (owner-
ship) were given to the land donees (grant receivers). In central and western India,
the villagers were also subjected to forced labour called Visti (forced labour) was
applied to all classes of subjects.
30.11 THE GUPTA  ADMINISTRATION
Administratively, the Gupta state was divided into provinces called desa or bhukti, and
these in turn into smaller units, the pradesa or visaya. The provinces were governed by
kumaramatyas, high imperial (royal) officers or members of the royal family. The shift
to smaller area of power of authority is evident from the composition of the municipal
board ( adhisthana-adhikarana), which consisted of the guild president ( nagara-
sresthin), the chief merchant (sarthavaha), and representatives of the artisans and of
the scribes. During this period the term samanta, which originally meant neighbour, was
beginning to be applied to intermediaries who had been given grants of land or to con-
quered feudatory rulers. There was also a noticeable tendency for some of the higher
administrative offices to become hereditary. The lack of firm control over conquered
areas led to their resuming independence. The repeated military action that this neces-
sitated may have strained the kingdom’s resources. The Gupta monarchs maintained a
standing army. The use of cavalry and horse archery became important in the army.
Special attention was paid to the safety of the border areas. Land tax and excise duties
were collected. The judicial system was developed and several law books were writ-
ten. For the first time Civil and Criminal Laws were differentiated."

30.12 POST GUPTA INDIAN POLITY
The system of governance under Harshavardhan and successive dynasties of Palas,
Pratiharas, Rashtrakutas and Chalukyas was centred on the personality of the king
which was hereditary post. System of vassalage was very much prevalent and fre-
quent wars among the kings and their vassals made the political situation fluid. The
states consisted of areas administered directly by the rulers and the areas ruled by the
vassal chiefs who were autonomous governing themself in their internal affairs. The
vassals had a general obligation of loyalty, paying a fixed tribute and supplying a quota
of troops to the overlord. The government was becoming “feudalized”.

30.13 THE CHOLA  STATE IN SOUTH INDIA
The Cholas were by far the most important dynasty in the subcontinent at this time,
although their activities mainly affected the peninsula and Southeast Asia. The nucleus
of Chola power during the reign of Vijayalaya in the late ninth century was Thanjavur,
from which the Cholas spread northward, annexing in the tenth century what remained
of Pallava territory. To the south they came up against the Pandyas. Chola history can
be reconstructed in considerable detail because of the vast number of lengthy inscrip-
tions issued not only by the royal family but also by temple authorities, village councils,
and trade guilds. Parantaka I (907–953) laid the foundation of the kingdom. He took the
northern boundary up to Nellore (Andhra Pradesh), where his advance was stopped by
a defeat at the hands of the Rashtrakuta king Krishna III. Parantaka was more suc-
cessful in the south, where he defeated both the Pandyas and the Gangas. He also
launched an abortive attack on Sri Lanka. For thirty years after his death, there was a
series of overlapping reigns that did not strengthen the Chola position. There then fol-
lowed two outstanding rulers who rapidly reinstated Chola power and ensured the king-
dom its supremacy. These were Rajaraja I and Rajendra.
Rajaraja (985–1014) began establishing power with attacks against the Pandyas and
Illamandalam (Sri Lanka). Northern Sri Lanka became a province of the Chola king-
dom. A campaign against the Gangas and Calukyas extended the Chola boundary
north to the Tungabhadra River. On the eastern coast the Cholas battled with the
Calukyas for the possession of Vengi. A marriage alliance gave the Cholas an
authoritative position, but Vengi remained a bone of contention. A naval campaign led
to the conquest of the Maldive Islands, the Malabar Coast, and northern Sri Lanka, all
of which were essential to the Chola control over trade with Southeast Asia and with"

Arabia and East Africa. These were the transit areas, ports of call for the Arab
traders and ships to Southeast Asia and China, which were the source of the valuable
spices sold at a high profit to Europe.
Rajaraja I’s son Rajendra participated in his father’s government from 1012, suc-
ceeded him two years later, and ruled until 1044. To the north he annexed the Raichur
Doab and moved into Manyakheta in the heart of Chalukya territory. A revolt against
Mahinda V of Sri Lanka gave Rajendra the excuse to conquer southern Sri Lanka as
well. In 1021–22 the now-famous northern campaign was launched. The Chola army
campaigned along the east coast as far as Bengal and then north to the Ganges
River- almost the exact reverse of Samudra Gupta’s campaign to Kanchipuram in the
4th century AD. The most spectacular campaign, however, was a naval campaign
against the Srivijaya kingdom in Southeast Asia in 1025. The reason for the assault on
Srivijaya and neighbouring areas appears to have been the interference with Indian
shipping and mercantile interests seeking direct trading connections with South China.
The Chola victory reinstated these connections, and throughout the eleventh century
Chola trading missions visited China.
30.14 EVOLUTION OF CHOLA ADMINISTRATION
The Chola State during the imperial period (850-1200) was marked for its uniqueness
and innovativeness. Cholas were the first dynasty who tried to bring the entire South
India under a common rule and to a great extent succeeded in their efforts. Although
the form and protocols of that government cannot be compared to a contemporary
form of government, the history of the Chola Empire belongs to a happy age in our
history, when in spite of much that appears to us as primitive, great things were
achieved by the government and the people.
The king was the supreme commander and a benevolent dictator. His share in the
administration consisted of issuing oral commands to responsible officers when rep-
resentations were made to him. Such orders were recorded in great detail in the
inscriptions, usually on the walls of temples. A special type of official, names
Tirumandira Olai Nayagam who recorded the oral orders immediately on palm leaf
manuscripts were responsible for the accurate.
There is no definite evidence of the existence of a council of ministers or of other
officers connected to the central government, though the names of individual ministers
are found in the inscriptions. A powerful bureaucracy assisted the king in the tasks of
administration and in executing his orders. Due to the lack of a legislature or a legislative
system in the modern sense, the fairness of king’s orders dependent on the goodness of
the man and in his belief in Dharma – sense of fairness and justice. The ancient society
did not expect anything more than general security from the government. Even matters
of disputes went to the officers of the court only as the last resort.
The Chola bureaucracy did not differ much from its contemporaries i.e others operating
during the same tune. However, what distinguished it was its highly organized nature. A
careful balance between central control and local independence was
maintained and non-interference in local government was sacrosanct (very important).
There was a definite hierarchy of the bureaucracy and the tenure of the officials simply
dependent on the ‘Crown’s pleasure’. The officials held various titles such as Marayan
and Adigarigal. Seniority between the same cadre was indicated by qualifying title
such as Perundanam and Sirutanam. One of the important officers were the Revenue
officials responsible for the receipts and expenditures of the government."

HISTORY
 EARLY  STATES
Every village was a self governing unit. A number of such villages constituted a
Korram or nadu or Kottam in different parts of the country. Taniyur was a large
village big enough to be a Kurram by itself. A number of Kurrams constituted a
Valanadu. Several Valanadus made up one Mandalam, a province. At the height of
the Chola Empire there were eight or nine of these provinces including Sri Lanka.
These divisions and names underwent constant changes throughout the Chola period.
An inscription of the eighth century BC at Uttaramerur temple describes the consti-
tution of the local council, eligibility and disqualifications for the candidates, the method
selection, their duties and delimits their power. It appears that the administration of a
common village Ur or Oor was different from that of a village gifted to brahmins.
The activities of the officials of the bureaucracy were under constant audit and scru-
tiny. We have an example of such reports in an inscription from the reign of Uththama
Chola which gives us the details of the carelessness and neglect of some officials in
the delay of recording a particular grant. As a result a dispute arose between con-
tending parties as to who should benefit from the grant. The officials involved were
punished. As the head of the civil administration, the king himself occasionally toured
the country and carried out inquests into the local administration. An extensive resur-
vey was done around 1089 by the Chola king Kulottunga, recording the extents of
lands and their assessment, boundaries of villages and the common rights inside the
village, including the communal pastures. Revenue officials were responsible for the
tax collection. The Chola government was very mindful of the need for the fair and
accurate collection of tax to run the state machinery. The revenue records were not
manuals of extortion (taking money unwillingly), but carefully maintained records of
land rights, based on complete enquired and accurate surveys, and were kept up-to-
date by regular surveys. The duties of revenue officials included many other spheres
of responsibilities. They also regulated receipts and expenditures of temples. They
were also seen to purchase land on behalf of village assemblies. They attested and
certified important documents drawn up by local government agencies such as village
councils. They were also shown to act as magistrates. Besides the tax collected by
the central government, several local bodies enjoyed the privilege of collecting tolls
and other imposts charges.
Justice was mostly a local matter in the Chola Empire, where minor disputes were
settled at the village level. The punishments for minor crimes were in the form of
fines or a direction for the offender to donate to some charitable endowment (body or
institution). Even crimes such as manslaughter or murder were punished by fines.
Crimes of the state such as treason vebollown were heard and decided by the king
himself and the typical punishment in such cases was either execution or confiscation
of property. Capital punishment was uncommon even in the cases of first-degree
murder. Only one solitary instance of capital punishment is found in all the records
available so far. Village assemblies exercised large powers in deciding local disputes.
Small committees called Nyayattar heard matters that did not come under the
jurisdiction of the voluntary village committees. The punishments in most cases were
in the form of donations to the temples or other endowments. The convicted person
would remit their fines at a place called Darmaasana. There is not much information
available on the judicial procedures or court records. There was no distinction
between civil and criminal offences. Sometimes civil disputes were allowed to drag
on until time offered the solution. Crimes such as theft, adultery and forgery were
considered serious offences. In most cases the punishment was in the order of the"

WHAT YOU HA VE LEARNT
In the begining human society had the belief that all humans being are equal and
should have same rights, as it was basically a tribal society. Development of a class
based society was an essential pre-requisite for changing the state system.
In the vedic monarchies, the clan-chief became the king and was gradually invested
with a status i.e. equal to being god. The existence of the state was primarily depen-
dent on two factors: danda (authority) and dharma. The emergence of the mauryan
empire stenghtened the political notion of monarchy, however, the decline of the
Mauryas, the re-emergence of an empire was to take many centuries.
The Aryans are said to have entered India through the fabled Khyber Pass, about
1500 BC and gave rise to another civilization in Indian history – the vedic period. The
Aryans were divided into tribes, which had settled in different regions of north–west-
ern India. Tribal chiefs bearing the little Raja or king were at first little more than
war–lords and their principal duty was protection of their tribes. The king was called
the obedience from his relicts in the reuse of a tribute to the king.
Following the conquest of kalings in a major was, Ashoka the great ended the military
expansion of the empire. The Mauryan empire was perhaps the greatest empire to
rule the Indian sub continent. Chandragupta’s ministers kautilya wrote the Arthashastra,
one of the greatest treatises on economics, politics, foreign affairs, administration,
military arts, ws and religion ever produced in the East.
The greatest empire in the fourth century AD was the Gupta Empire which referred
in the golden age of Indian history. The empire lasted more than two centureis.

THE MEDIEV AL STATE
31
Notes
In this study material the discussion is on the emergence, nature and expansion of
states which emerged in medieval India. The two major state formations discussed
here are Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire. The medieval rulers basically came
from outside India thus they had to influence as well as learn from native political
structures. Medieval state may be characterized as a polity headed by a strong ruler,
supported by hierarchically organized administrative machinery and legitimized by the
authority of religion.  The army, bureaucracy by blood and land revenue remained the
basic elements of the state. But each ruler had to balance the competing groups for
power sharing.
OBJECTIVES
After studying this lesson, you will be able to:
• analyse the evolution of state in medieval India;
• recall the nature of medieval state and
• explain the institutions of medieval state.
31.1 THE BACKGROUND
Since the decline of the Gupta state the Indian polity saw decentralization and rise
of various regional states. Transition from early to medieval period saw tripartite
struggle among the three regional powers- Palas of Bengal, Pratiharas of northern
India and Rashtrakutas of Peninsular India. V ery soon northern India saw the emer-
gence of Rajput small kings aspiring to become kingdoms. But the arrival of the
Turks from north western direction saw emergence of new process of an extended
medieval state.
31.2 DELHI SULTANATE
Ilbari Turks
In the thirteenth century, a new kind of dynastic domain emerged in North India. The
Delhi Sultanate had its origin in victories by Muhammad Ghauri, who sacked Ghazni
in 1151, and then expelled Ghaznavids to Punjab, in1157. Muhammad Ghauri marched"

into the Indus basin to uproot the Ghaznavids in 1186. On the way, his armies
conquered Multan (1175), Sind (1182), Peshawar and Lahore (1186).  In 1190, he
occupied Bhatinda, which triggered battles with the Rajput King Prithviraj Chauhan,
whom he finally defeated in 1192.  Having broken the Rajput hold on western
routes to the Ganga basin, the Ghaurid armies marched eastward until Bakhtyar
Khalji finally defeated Laksmanasena in Bengal, in 1200. Muhammad Ghauri died
in 1206. His trusted Mamluk (ex–slave) general, Qutb–ud–din–Aibak, governor of
Delhi, then declared an independent rule. This dynasty of Ilbari Turks was the first
in a series that became collectively known as the Delhi Sultanate. Later Ghaurid
and Ghaznavid efforts to bring Delhi back into their fold were finally defeated by
the Delhi Sultan Iltutmish in 1211–1236. Iltutmish must be regarded as the real
consolidator of the Turkish conquests in north India. He gave the new state capital,
Delhi, a monarchical form of government and governing class. He introduced
Iqta–grant of revenue from a territory in lieu of salary. He maintained a central
army and introduced coins of Tanka (silver) and Jital (copper). The famous Qutub
Minar was completed during his reign. Iltutmish nominated his daughter Raziya
(Raziyyat–ud–Din) to be his successor. Still, the new state had enough internal
momentum to survive severe factional disputes during the 10 years following
Iltutmish’s death, when four of Iltutmish’s children or grandchildren were in turn
raised to the throne and deposed. This momentum was maintained largely through
the efforts of Iltutmish’s personal slaves, who came to be known as the Forty
(Chihilgan), a political faction whose membership was characterized by talent and
by loyalty to the family of Iltutmish.  The political situation had changed by 1246,
when Ghiyas-ud-din Balban, a junior member of the Forty, had gained enough power
to attain a controlling position within the administration of the newest sultan, Nasir–
ud–din Mahmud (reigned 1246–66). Balban, acting first as na’ib (deputy) to the
sultan and later as Sultan (reigned 1266-87), was the most important political figure
of his time. Balban stressed the special position of Sultan as ‘Shadow of God’ (Zill-
al–Allah) on earth. Balban emphasized courtly splendour, decorum and etiquette.
He also believed in severe setting example punishments even to the nobles. Blaban’s
immediate successors, however, were unable to manage either the administration
or the intergroup conflicts between the old Turkish nobility and the new forces, led
by the Khaljis; after a struggle between the two factions, Jalal-ud-din Firuz Khalji
assumed the sultanate in 1290.
The Khaljis
The Khaljis were not recognized by the older nobility as coming from pure Turkish
stock (although they were Turks), and their rise to power was aided by impatient
outsiders, some of them Indian-born Muslims, who might expect to enhance their
positions if the hold of the followers of Balban and the Forty were broken. To some
extent, then, the Khalji power seizure was a move toward the recognition of a
shifting balance of power, believed to be the result of both to the developments
outside the territory of the Delhi Sultanate, in Central Asia and Iran, and to the
changes that followed the establishment of Turkish rule in northern India. Under
the Khaljis external policy of conquest and internal methods of absolute control
were followed through military expeditions and regulations. The Khaljis used their
Afghan descent to win the loyalties of the discontented nobles, who felt that they
had been neglected by the earlier sultans.  Jalaluddin Khalji (1290 AD – 1296 AD)
tried to mitigate some of the harsh aspects of Balban’s rule.  He was the first ruler"

to put forward the view that the state should be based on the willing support of the
governed and that since the majority of Indians were Hindus, the state cannot be
truly Islamic.
In 1296 he was assassinated by his ambitious nephew and successor, Ala–ud–
Din Khalji. During the reign of Ala-ud-din Khalji (1296–1316), the sultanate briefly
assumed the status of an empire.  In order to achieve his goals of centralization
and expansion, Ala-ud-din needed money, loyal and reasonably obeying nobility,
and an efficient army under his personal control. He had earlier, in 1292, partly
solved the problem of money when he conducted a lucrative raid into Bhilsa in
central India. Using that success to build his position and a fresh army, he led a
brilliant and unauthorized raid on the fabulously wealthy Devagiri (modern
Daulatabad), the capital of the Yadavas, in the Deccan early in 1296. The wealth
of Devagiri not only financed his usurpation but provided a good foundation of  his
state-building plans. Centralization and heavy agrarian taxation were the princi-
pal features of Ala-ud-din’s rule. The magnitude and mechanism of agrarian taxa-
tion enabled the sultan to achieve two important objectives: (1) to ensure supplies
at low prices to grain carriers, and (2) to fill the state granaries with a buffer
stock, which, linked with his famous price regulations, came as a solution to the
critical financial problem of maintaining a large standing army.  Within five years
after Ala–ud–din’s death (1316), the Khaljis lost their power. The succession
dispute resulted in the murder of Malik Kafur by the palace guards and in the
blinding of Ala-ud-din’s six-year-old son by Qutb-ud-din Mubarak shah, the Sultan’s
third son, who assumed the sultanate (1316–20). He was murdered by his favourite
general, a Hindu convert named Khusraw Khan. Opposition to Khusraw’s rule
arose immediately, led by Ghazi Malik, the warden of the western marches at
Deopalpur, and Khusraw was defeated and slained after four months.
The Tughluqs
Ghazi Malik, who ascended the throne as Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq (reigned 1320–
25), had distinguished himself prior to his accession by his successful defense of
the frontier against the Mongols. The Tughlaqs also wished to rule the whole of
India. Ghiyasuddin’s (1320–1325) campaign to Warangal, Orissa and Bengal were
directed towards this end. He built the city Tughlaqabad near Delhi. While return-
ing from the Bengal campaign, the Sultan was killed when a wooden shelter col-
lapsed on him at Afghanpur, near Delhi. The reign (1325–51) of Muhammad bin
Tughlaq marked both the high point of the sultanate and the beginning of its decline.
The period from 1296 to 1335 can be seen as one of nearly continuous centraliza-
tion and expansion. In  fourteeth century chronicle of Firuz Shah Tughluq’s reign in
Delhi, contemporary historian Ziauddin Barani said that, “history is the knowledge
of the annals i.e. the historical records and traditions of prophets, caliphs, sultans,
and great men of religion and government.” The Tughlaq dynasty ended soon after
the Timur’s invasion but sultanage survived, though it was merely a shadow of its
former self. Timur’s nominee captured Delhi and was proclaimed the new sultan
and the first of Sayyid Dynasty (1414 AD – 1451 AD), which was to rule the
earlier half of the fifteenth century.  Their rule was short-lived and confined to a
radius of some 200 miles around Delhi. They kept the machinery going until a more
capable dynasty, the Lodhis, took over. The Lodhis were of pure Afghan origin, and
brought an eclipse to the Turkish nobility."

31.3 THE MUGHALS
In 1526, Babur from Central Asia established Mughal dynasty in India. Babur claimed
descend from both Timur and Genghis Khan.  His conquest of Delhi and Ganga basin
was before the final step in the rise of warrior power in South Asia.  The greatest
sultans in South Asia were Mughal emperors who (though part Turk through Babur
and Timur) adopted Persian imperial culture and took the Persian title Padshah to lift
themselves symbolically above Turks, Afghans, and all other sultans. Babur was a
Chagatai Turk who fled patrimonial lands near Samarkand to escape Uzbek armies.
He followed opportunity into the Ganga basin, where he used Uzbek-style fast-horse
tightly packed together cavalry equipped with muskets and canon to sweep away the
opposition.  In 1526, he had conquered sultans from Punjab to Bengal. But opposition
survived. Thirteen years later, an Afghan soldier who had fought for the Lodis and for
Babur, and who styled himself Sher Shah to demonstrate his Persian education (at
Jaunpur), declared a new dynasty in Bengal and Bihar. Sher Shah’s armies then beat
Babur’s son, Humayun, back to Afghanistan, where Humanyan raised his own son,
Akbar, in exile. The Sur dynasty did not survive the Shah’s death, though its lasting
accomplishments included administrative innovations and a trunk road from Bengal to
Pubjab. Soon after Sher Shah died, Humayun conquered Delhi, in 1555.  He died
there by accident. His thirteen year old son, Akbar, then ascended his throne under
his regent, Bairam Khan. Akbar was crowned in 1556, as Bairam Khan conquered
strategic fortress cities at Lahore, Delhi, Agra, and Jaunpur. Bairam Khan had also
conquered Malwa and Rajsthan before he was ousted as regent and assassinated.
Akbar ruled for fifty years (1556- 1650). He continued to conquer to the end."

His armies surpassed all before in there size, funding, leadership, technology, and
success. At his death, his domains stretched from Kabul, Kashmir, and Punjab to
Gujarat, Bengal, and Assam; and they were still increasing in the south and up into
mountains on all sides. His mantle was passed to his son, Jahangir (1605–1627) then
to his grandson, Shah Jahan (1627–1658), and to his great-grandson. Aurangzeb (1658–
1707), whose death was followed by imperial fragmentation.Though the dynasty
survived until 1858, when it was dethroned by the British. The Mughal Empire at its
peak commanded resources unprecedented in Indian history and covered almost the
entire subcontinent. Form 1556 to 1707, during the hey–day of its fabulous wealth and
glory, the Mughal Empire was a fairly efficient and centralized organization, with a
vast complex of personnel, money, and information dedicated to the dervice of the
emperor and hid nobility.
Much of the empire’s expansion during this period was attributable to India’s growing
commercial and cultural contact with the outside world. The sixteenth and seven-
teenth centuries brought the establishment and expansion of European and non-Euro-
pean trading organizations in the subcontinent, principally for the procurement of
Indian goods in demand abroad, Indian regions drew close to each other by means of
a dense overland and coastal trading network. Significantly incresining the internal
surplus of precious metals. With expanded connections to the wider world came also
new ideologies and technologies to challenge and enrich the imperial edifice. The
empire itself, however, was a purely Indian historical experience. Mughal culture
blended Perso-Islamic and regional Indian elements into a distinctive but variegated
whole. Although by the early eighteenth century,  the regions had begun to reassert
their independent positions, the Mughal period outlasted imperial central authority.
The imperial centre, in fact, came to be controlled by the direction of the Mughal
Empire over its first 200 years (1526–1748) thus provides a fascinating illustration of
pre–modern state building in the Indian subcontinent.
31.4 NATURE OF MEDIEV AL STATE
What did it mean to be a Sultan? In the Quran this Arabic word represent a man with
spiritual power. Mahmud of Ghazni was the first man to be styled “Sultan” by
contemporaries, which indicates his success in cultivating admirers. The title seems
to have been popular first among Turks. Seljuq dynasties in Western and Central Asia
were the to use this title of ‘Sultan’ routinely, and later, Ottoman Turks made it fa-
mous in Europe. When the Caliph began conferring the title, it spread quickly among
Muslim rulers and changed along the way. The Sultans of Delhi acknowledged the
sovereignty of Caliph of Baghdad and considered their kingdom as a part of Dar–ul–
Islam of which the Caliph was the juridical head. India under the Mughal emperors
was governed under the Muslim law Sharia. Even so neither under the Sultans of
Delhi nor under the Mughal Emperors did the state confirm absolutely to Islamic
ordinances since it had to adapt itself to the realities and often may not be the correct
one. The Turkish and Afghan rulers of India had to treat the Hindus, who formed the
vast majority of the population, with consideration and toleration. In fields relating to
religion, property and several other non- religious affairs, the non–Muslim population
was allowed full freedom to have their cases tried by their own communal courts.
The land revenue system under the Sultan and the ceremonies and the procedure at
the royal court bear the unmistakable evidence of Indian tradition. The question arises
that whether the medieval Indian state was government by priest? In formal sense"

HISTORY
 THE MEDIEV AL STATE
the medieval state under the Muslim rule was definitely a theocracy, since it had all its
essential elements- the sovereignty of God and government by the direction of the
God through priests in accordance with divine laws. The Sultans of Delhi considered
themselves as deputies or assistants of the Caliph who was God’s representation.
Sher Shah and Islam Shah assumed the title of Caliph and the Mughal Emperors,
from Akbar to Aurangzeb, adopted titled like ‘Shawdow of God’, and ‘Agent of God
on earth’. The sovereignty of God was unquestioned. The supremacy of the Sharia
was always acknowledged, though Akbar added to the Sharia the state laws. How-
ever, these rulers did not allow the Muslim divines to dictate the policies of the state.
Basically, defense, law and order and collection of revenue were the primary concerns
of the Sultanate of Delhi. In other matters, it generally followed a policy of non interfer-
ence, as the welfare of the people was not the primary concern of the sultans.
Toleration under the Sultans was the exception rather than the rule. Thus, while
claiming to be Islamic the state of Delhi Sultanate was militaristic and aristocratic in
character. In contrast the Mughal Empire stood on altogether different ground.
Toleration and kindness were the guiding principles of Akbar’s government. Akbar
considered his subjects as his children and hence held himself responsible for their
welfare. The state as conceived by Abul Fazl and established by Akbar was not con-
fined to any particular class and was based on the principle of ‘peace with all’ (Sulh-i-
Kul). But in spite of Akbar’s enlightened policy and its circumstantial continuation by
Jahangir and Shah Jahan, the Mughal rule had limited scope in its function. In spite of
imparting charities and kind Monarchs the Mughal state was not a welfare state.
Extraction of the land revenue and defense were its main functions. The form of gov-
ernment was a Monarchy which in spite of being hereditary could not develop a well
defined law of succession. Theoretically, the king was the fountainhead of all branches
of the government but weak persona of the ruler could provide the opportunity to the
nobility and the ulema to exercise effective check on the royal power.

31.5 THE KINGSHIP
Whatever his title, a monarch was a man of personal greatness, not only as an army
commander but as a spiritual and moral being. A man of civilization, his wars were
civilizing, by definition, though what this meant varied and changed. A Sultan’s
grandeur emerged from the work of people around him. Putting halos on Muslim
monarchs was a job for poets, scholars (imams and ulema), architects, chroniclers,"

biographers, spiritual guides ( sufis), and Friday prayer leaders at the Jama Masjid,
the great congregational mosque essential in any domain. Skilled service providers
and cultural activists competed for the honors to glorify sultans, and in doing so the
Sultan’s personality thus emerged in context. Experts and allies around him shaped
his opinions, policies, and priorities. He cultivated people to secure his success; and
his power depended on their power. Thus the social institution of a monarch’s  power
extended well beyond the throne. Early Sultans like Mahmud of Ghazni relied entirely
on kin and close ethnic allies. As the political landscape became more complex, more
complex personalities developed and under the Mughals assumed epic proportions.
The Sultan’s body, speech, piety, personal habits, hobbies, family. Household, ances-
tors, wives, son, and in-laws formed the inner core of his public identity; they ap-
peared in public gossip, art, lore, song, and chronicle.
31.6 THE ROYAL COURT
A daily dramatization of the Sultan’s public self occurred in his court. At his public
darbar,  where he received guests, ambassadors, supplicants, allies, and payers of
taxes and tribute.The institution of the darbar evolved over time. Its early Central
Asian home was a regal tent on the battlefield’ in later centuries, it acquired architec-
tural grandeur, as at the Mughal fort- cities in Fatehpur Sikri, Agra, and Delhi, whose
darbar halls are massive stages for the emperor’s performance of power. Many
darbars incorporated Hindu and Muslim traditions of display and drama. We have a
detailed rendering of darbar scenes in eighteenth century paintings that now accom-
pany the seventeenth century pardshahanama, the chronicle or the Mughal emperor
Shah Jahan. These illustrations show hanging rugs that recall the darbar’ s nomadic
heritage, and each and every person depicted in the paintings had a specific rank at
court and relation to the emperor. The darbar became a place for dramatizing in
public all the personal  identities that were being defined in relation to sultans. To
dramatize all the various personalities of power that comprised his domain, a sultans,
took his darbar wherever he went. A darbar spent considerable time on the move,
especially in battle. The ruler’s traveling court became an enduring cultural phenom-
enon; and in later centuries, touring administrators, tax collectors, and politicians ef-
fectively became touring sultans of modern times.
31.7 PERSONA OF THE KING
A Sultan’s retinue(a group of retainers in attendance), regalia privileges & a king  and
family symbolized his greatness. Sultans were sticklers for public etiquette and lim-
ited protocol, lest subordinates exceed their station. The sultan had to have the big-
gest, richest, most elaborate, extravagant, valuable things visible on his person, to
dramatize his ascendancy constantly. Vijayanagar Rayas styled themselves “Lords
of the Eastern and Western Oceans” by adorning their bodies with precious com-
modities from overseas trade, specifically, perfumes and precious things like Chinese
porcelain. The Sultan’s home was a larger version of his own body and dramatized
his power to accumulate, command, control, and define wealth, value and taste. The
grandiose habits of consumption of the great influencer became an enduring fact of
political life in South Asia.
Significant features of a Sultan’s persona emerged in publicly visible domestic
dramas, above all, marriage. Weddings were great events of political life because
marriage was the most secure method of political alliance. In the padshahnama,
warfare and weddings are depicted by the artists most elaborately. Even the Mughal"

HISTORY
 THE MEDIEV AL STATE
Empire was at bade a family affair. In the inner secret deep inside area of the palace,
family members vied for influence and engaged in the secret plans that often culmi-
nated in wars of succession, in which relatives killed one another, as they did in the epic
Mahabharata. At home, the Sultan’s honour rested on the stainless virtue of his mother,
wives, daughters, and sisters. Seperated from public view women of the palace lived
behind a curtain, pardah; and women in seclusion, pardahnasheen, became the sultan’s
own virtue. Practices of female seclusion spread among elites who modeled them-
selves on sultans, Hindus and Muslims alike, at all levels of society.
31.8 THE NOBILITY
The sultans looked different titles that indicate ethnic origins and cultural affiliations in
addition to marking personal status. Every Sultan sought to form and organize a group of
nobles which would be personally loyal to him. Thus not only the Turkan-i- Chihalgani
(Group of Forty nobles) tried to capture all privileges and power but groups having per-
sonal loyalty to Sultans like Qutbis (loyal to Qutub-ud- din Aibak), Shamsis (loyal to shams-
ud-din Iltutmish), Balbanis and Alai amirs remained dominant throughout this period. Al-
most all the high nobles, including the famous Forty in the thirteenth century, were of
Central Asian origin; many of them were slaves purchased from the Central Asian ba-
zaars. The same phenomenon also led to the destabilization of the core of the Turkish
Mamluks. With the Mongol plunder of Central Asia and eastern Iran, many more mem-
bers of the political and religious elite of these regions were thrown into north India,where
they were admitted into various levels of the military and administrative cadre by the Delhi
Sultans. Ala-ud-din was one of the first rulers to deliberately expand political participation
within the sultanate government. Not only did he partly open the gates to power for the
non-Turkish Muslim nobility-some of whom were even converted Hindus within the politi-
cal world he viewed as legitimate. Both Ala-ud-din and his son married into the families of
important Hindu rulers, and several such rulers were received at court and treated with
respect. Under the Tughluq, the non-Mumlim Indians rose to high and extremely respon-
sible officers, including the governorships of provices. Muhammad bin Tughluq was the
first Muslim ruler to planned efforts to induct Hindus into administration.
Within the first three decades of Akbar’s reign, the imperial person of the highest class
has grown enormously. As the Central Asian nobles had generally been nurtured on the
Turko – Mongol tradition of sharing power with the royalty – an arrangement not in tune
with Akbar’s ambition of structuring the Mughal Centralism around himself – the
emperor’s principal goal was to reduce their strength and influence. The emperor en-
couraged new elements to join his service, and Iranians came to form an important
block of the Mughal nobility. Akbar also looked for new men of Indian background.
Indian Afghans, being the principal opponents of the Mughals, were obviously to be kept
at a distance; but the Sayyids of Baraha, the Bukhari Sayyids, and the Kambus among
the Indian Muslims were specially favoured for high military and civil positions. More
significant was the recruitment of Hindu Rajput leaders into the Mughal nobility. This
was a major step, even if not completely new in Indo – Islamic history, leading to a
standard pattern of relationship between the Mughal autocracy and local cruel rulers.
31.9 OFFICES AND HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE
Neither the government of the Delhi Sultanate nor that of the Mughal Empire was
slave like. Both the governments were organized bureaucracy with regular gradation
of departments and officers. No officers, either civil or military, was hereditary and"

thus the officers were appointed, transferred and dismissed by the Monarch at his will
and were accountable to him only. Under the Sultanate immediately after Sultan the
office of Wazir was there to supervise all affairs of the government. The Mughals
called their Prime Minister as Wakil, later on synonymous with wazir or diwan. The
Sultans established the Diwan–i–Arz  (the Military Department) Headed by
Ariz–i– Mumalik while under the Mughals Mir Bakshi was in–charge of army and
general administration of royal establishment. In Sultanate religious affairs and charity
were looked after by Diwan–i–Risalat headed by Sadr–us–Sudur (chief sadr). As
far as the officer was concerned Mughals continued with the same title. Both the
regimes combined the office of Chief Qazi (Chief Justice) with that of sadr. In Sultan-
ate Mushrif–i–Mamalik (Accountant General), Mushaufi–i–Mamalik (Auditor Gen-
eral), Diwan–i–Insha (State Correspondence Department) headed by Dabir–i–Khas
and Barid–i–Mumalik (Head of the Intelligence Department) were some important
offices and departments.
31.10 PROVINCIAL ADMINISTRATION
Under the Sultanate muqtis or walis were  in –change of the provinces. Provinces also
had a Sahib–i–diwan assisted by mutasarrifs and karkuns to control income and expen-
diture in the end of the thirteenth century Shiqq emerged as an administrative division
later known as Sarkar as well. For justice courts of the Qazi and the Sadr functioned in
the provinces. The Mughal empire was divided into 15 provinces–Allahabad, Agra,
Avadh, Ajmer, Ahmadabad, Bihar, Bengal, Delhi, Kabul, Lahore, Multan, Malka,
Qhandesh, Berar, and Ahmadnagar. Kashmir and Qandahar were districts of the prov-
ince of Kabul, Sindh, then known as Thatta, was a district in the province of Multan.
Orissa formed a part of Bengal. The provinces were not of uniform area or income.
There were in each province a governor, a dewan (revenue and finance officer), a
bakhshi (military commander), a sadr (religious administrator), and qazi (judge) and
agents who supplied information to the central government. Separation of powers among
the various officials (in particular, between the governor and the diwan) was a
significant operating principal in imperial administration. The Mughal provinces were
also divided into districts (sarkars). Each district had a faujdar (a military officer whose
duties roughly corresponded to those of a collector); a qazi, a bitikchi (head clerk); and
a khazanedar (treasurer). Justice was administered by a hierarchy of courts rising from
village panchayat to the pargana, sarkar and provincial courts (under the Qazi,
Amir–i– Dad and Mir Adl) and finally to the chief sadr cum qazi and ultimately the
emperor himself. Both under Sultanate and Mughal, the Kotwal was the enforcer of
law at the local level.
31.11 IQTA, JAGIR AND MANSAB
Iqta under the Sultanate and Jagir under the Mughals were developed as the officers
for the collection of revenue which Iqtadars or jagirdars realized on behalf of the state
with a view to obtain their salary. But their judicial preview over hand depended on the
pleasure of the emperor. The muqtis or iqta holders were required to furnish military
assistance to the Sultans in times of need, apart from maintaining law and order and
collecting the revenue from their iqta. These revenue assignments were generally
non–hereditary and transferable. Similarly, the Mansab system was based upon the
organization of the public services of the Mughal Empire. It was neither hereditary nor
hierarchical. Mansab means literally a rank or a position which was fixed according to"

 THE MEDIEV AL STATE
the personal merit and status (zat) of the officer and the contingent (sawar) he
maintained. Generally, the mansabdars were assigned a territory known as a jagir, who’s
estimated revenue (Jama) was equal to the pay due for both their zat and sawar mansabs,
though some mansabdars were also paid in cash from the imperial treasury.
31.12 TAXATION
The system of taxation in Sutanate comprised taxes like Kharaj (varied from one
sixth to one third of the gross produce), Jaziya (levied upon adult non- Muslim males
with independent means of maintenance in lieu of military service), Zakat (a tax
raised from well to do Muslims for the purpose of charity), Khams or Ghaninah (the
booty taken in war) and other transit and octroi duties along with natural resources
were the main sources of income. The chaudhuris, muqqadams and khuts were the
village revenue collector functioning under the amils, shiqdars and provincial muqtis.
Khalisa land revenue was reserved for the Sultan’s treasury only. The Mughals
improved upon this system particularly in the area of land revenue. The system of
measurement zabt introduced by Sher Shah Suri was adopted and improved by Akbar.
Ultimately, Ain–i–Dahsala the final method of revenue settlement was based upon
the average annual yied of the previous ten years from a particular field. The
Gaz–i– Ilahi, a new yard for land measurement brought uniformity in the land survey.
Productivity of the land, nature of the crop, prices, and irrigation facilities were the
other major factors deciding the cash value of the revenue demand of the govern-
ment. Option of paying land tax could be done through various systems. Ownership
of the land always belonged to the cultivator.
31.13 ARMY
Both the Sultanate and the Mughal state were dependent on army whose main strength
was the cavalry. Ariz–i–Mumalik under the Sultans and Mir Bakshi under the Mughal
Emperors were the officers in – charge but the ruler himself commanded all the armed
forces. Balban was the first one to recruit a regular standing army, this system was
further strengthened by Ala–ud–din–Khalji who introduced the branding system (Dagh)
of the horses. The royal cavalry in Delhi Sultanate was called Hasham–i–Qalb or
Afwaj–i–Qalb. Hasham–i–Atraj was the cavalry posted at provincial level. This army
was organized on the basis of decimal system. Mughal army was organized on the basis
of mansab system, described above. Ahadis were the royal troopers directly under the
command of the emperor. The artillery had developed rapidly in India after the advent
of Babur. Apart from siege i.e. the p rocess of surrounding and attacking a fortified
place there were heavy guns mounted on forts. The infantry, though numerous,
consisted of both fighting and non- fighting classes. The fighting men were mainly
matchlock men, called banduqchis. By the time of Akbar, matchlock contingent was
also included in the infantry. Both Sultans of Delhi and Mughals used elephants on the
battle fields. Navy always remained a weak point of the Indian rulers.
31.14 CURRENCY SYSTEM
The standard coin under the Sultans from Iltutmish onwards was the silver tanka
weighing 175grains. The currency system was, however, bimetallic, there being
parallel coin in copper, the basic unit of which was the jital. In the fourteenth century,
48 or 50 jitals were held equal in worth to tanka. The Sultans issued bullion coins as"

well, and gold issues have also survived. The Lodis, who never minted silver, issued a
heavy bullion coin 145 grains called bahloli. Sher Shah Suri established a bimetallic
system by issuing a rupee of silver and making the tanka a purely copper coin. The
Mughals from Akbar onwards continued the same system: their rupee weighed 178
grains (180 under Aurangzeb), and the alloy in these never rose above 4 per cent. In
copper they minted dams of 323 grains each, these being originally the half tanka of
Sher Shah. In the last years of Akbar, a rupee fetched 40 dams, and this became
subsequently the paper value of the rupee. In fact, the copper price of the rupee
declined throughout the seventeenth century. The Mughals also issued gold coins,
known as mohur or asharfi, but these were not normally used in the market. The Mughal
coinage was of great metallic purity and uniformity. The minting was ‘free’ in the sense
that any one could take bullion to the mint and get in coined at a small charge.

Thus the growth of the medieval state was an ever growing process along with
conquests and consolidations. In the art of the governance certain central Asian
institutions were introduced but at the same time previous practices were not
substantially disturbed. As far as organization of the administration and ruling class
were concerned, it was not a monolithic structure. Each monarch as a single source
of power had to establish a balance between varying compositions and interest groups
to ensure the durability and stability of his dynasty. But the set of beliefs of a
composite culture was always taken care of.
WHAT YOU HA VE LEARNT
With the decline of the Gupta state, the Indian polity saw decentralization and rise of
various regional states. In the 13th century, a new kind of domain   emerged in North
India. The Delhi Sultanate had its origin in victories by Mohammad Ghauri, who
sacked Ghazni in 1151, Ghazni’s armies conquered Multan, Sind, Peshawar and Lahore.
Later Iltutmish was regarded as the real consolidator of the Turkish conquests in
North India."

HISTORY
 THE MEDIEV AL STATE
The political situation had changed by 1246 when Ghiyas-ud-din gained enough power
and acted first as naib (duty) to the Sultan and later as Sultan (1266–87) was the most
important political figure of his time. In 1296 he was assassinated by his ambitions
nephew and successor, Ala–ud–Din Khalji. During his reign (1296–1316) the
sultanate briefly assumed the status of an empire. However, within five years after
Ala–ud–din’s death the khaljis lost their power.
Ghiyas–ud–din Tughlaq (1320–25) and Mohammad bin Tughlaq marked the high point
of the sultanate and wished to rule the whole of India. It was the period of continuous
centralization and expansion.
In 1526, Babur from central Asia established Mughal dynasty in India. His con-
quests of Delhi, Ganga basin and later from Punjab to Bengal entitled him to take
the persian title of padshah. His son Humayun lost to Sher Shah and retreated to
Afghanistan. After Sher Shah’s death Humayun conquered Delhi in 1555 and died
by accident. His 13year old son Akbar ascended the throne and under the guidance
of his regent Bairam Khan conquered the strategic fortress cities of Lahore, Agra
and Jaunpur. Akbar ruled from, 1556-1605. His domain stretched from Kabul, Kash-
mir, Punjab to Gujrat, Bengal and Assam. His successors Jahangir (1605–1627)
and grandson Shah–Jahan (1627–1658) and great grand –son Aurangzeb (1658-
1707). The Mughal Empire was at its peak, commanded resources unprecedented
in Indian history.
The 16th and 17th centuries brought the establishment and expansion of European and
non–European trading organization in the sub continent, principally for the
procurement of Indian goods in demand abroad.

Notes
When Britain assumed the sovereignty of India i.e. the supreme power, the imperial-
colonial relationship had to be established through or explanation of British rule over
India proving the local Indian rules as incompetent or backward in order to curb their
legal authority. The political authority of the colonial state gathered upon many instru-
ments for preserving and enforcing its power which was a pre- condition for the
formulation of the colonial policy. It is important to know that how the rule over people
was legitimized and how was the power of the colonial state made visible to the
common people subjected to foreign rule.
OBJECTIVES
After studying this lesson, you would be able to:
• understand the meaning and nature of the colonial state;
• recall the colonial objectives in India;
• identify the instruments of colonial control and
• explore the symbols and effects of the colonial rule
32.1 THE  BACKGROUND
The Mughal Empire declined in the first half of the eighteenth century. The political
vacuum was filled by the rise of regional states like Bengal, Hyderabad, Awadh,
Punjab and Maratha Kingdom. But these regional powers could not provide political
stability resulting into a shameless chance for the British East India Company to
establish a territorial empire in India. Now a set of institutions and regulations were
required to govern India through colonial machinery.
(i) Meaning of Colonial State
Prior to the British conquest, relations between regional people and the sovereign
power had never been defined wholly by religion. A web of economic and social
relationship had survived periods of imperial consolidation, crisis and collapse, to bind
the subcontinent into a loosely layered framework of interdependence. Despite a long
history of creatively accommodating multiple levels of supreme powers, the
renegotiation of the terms for sharing power in an independent India saw the special
opportunity of a rigid and massive conception of territorial sovereignty based on a"

 COLONIAL  STATE
singular and gathering together idea of the ‘nation’. The colonial state means the
assumption of sovereignty (legally independent power to govern and control) of a coun-
try by a foreign political entity. The colonial state has to design a theory of sovereignty in
the special context of the imperial-colonial relationship. This is done through a two way
process (1) process of legitimization of the colonial state i.e. justification of the legal
existence of a foreign entity, which automatically leads to the second process i.e. (2) the
subversion of delegitimization of pre-colonial indigenous political authority.
(ii) Nature of Colonial State
The British consolidated their Colonial regime in India according to their ideas of what
a colonial state could be and a modern state with some modern characteristics emerged.
As in a modern state, the colonial government had a monopoly of force, a centralized
administration for tax – collection, a centralized legal system, a professional staff of
administrators and bureaucrats, and clearly defined territorial boundaries. British co-
lonial administrators aimed for a rule based on law, administered according to regula-
tions. At the lowest levels, however, where policy implementation took place, the ties
of caste, clan and kinship and patron-client relations played major roles in how the
colonial state affected local society. After Independence in 1947, the new nation built
its government on institutions inherited form the colonial, with all of their strengths and
their weaknesses.
(iii) Colonial Objectives in India
In the course of the 19th century a British royal or imperial ideology emerged in which
the British, as the wealthiest and most progressive nation in the world, had a duty to help
rest of the world to prosper and improve. The rule of law would create the conditions
for civilized living and the creation of wealth. In India the governing ideology was:
1. Indians were not capable of governing themselves.
2. Britain had the duty to supply good government which would be based on the rule
of law, without interfering in or attempting to manage Indian economy and society.
The main responsibilities of imperial government were seen as:
a) Collecting land revenue and   b) Execution of legal administration.
The type of revenue settlement which the East India Company made, varied accord-
ing to the prevailing ideology of how to create wealth in India, according to the
Company’s security needs and according to experience which the Company gained
as new areas came under its control.
The colonial state was working with two aims (1) the complete subordination of the
Indian colony to needs of British metropolis and (2) economic exploitation of the
Indian colony or the appropriation of the colonies economic surplus by the British
metropolis. But the nature of the imperial interests in Indian did not remain the same
through-out and it changed according to the requirements of the Mother country and
in interest of the different social group in Britain. During the first stage of British rule
in India till 1813, British interests lay mainly in (i) the East India Company’s monopoly
of trade with India, and the elimination of other European competitors, (ii) the control
over financial resources, through taxation.
Both these objectives could be fulfilled without having to disturb the existing institu-
tions and administrative apparatus. British rulers at this stage were not very different
from that of traditional rulers, interested mainly in receiving agricultural surplus."

HISTORY
 COLONIAL  STATE
No attempt was, therefore, made to create a uniform administrative structure or even to
renovate the old one at this stage. No basic changes were introduced in the judicial system
and administration. Whatever little changes were made in the field of administration were
only made at the top of the revenue collection and were linked to the objective of smooth
revenue collection. A modern judicial system or uniform administrative structure for India
was not seen as necessary at this stage, since it was not considered relevant for the
fulfillment of British objective during the first stage of British rule in India.
This scenario changed considerably after 1813. The British economy and society
were going through a major transformation, caused mainly by the Industrial revolu-
tion. The commercial trading corporations were now giving way to industrial owner-
ship which had become the dominant force in the British society. The East India
Company was gradually losing its monopoly over Indian trade. The British interests in
India no longer represented the interests of the Company but of the industrial capital-
ist class. The interest of the British industrialists lay in using India as (a) a market for
their manufactured industrial goods, (b) a source of raw material like (jute, cotton
etc.) for their industries and food grains, opium etc. for export.
All this required much greater penetration into the India economy and society and
control over India trade not only with British but with other countries also. India was
now expected to play a new role. It was perhaps not possible to perform the new role
with the traditional administrative institutions. They had to be changed and trans-
formed to suit the new requirements. Thus started the process of transforming Indian
administration. Similarly, the entire legal structure had to be overhauled to promote
modern business, create a market economy, free commercial relations and to regulate
the various economic transactions smoothly with the help of modern laws.
British interests were of several kinds. At first the main purpose was to achieve a
monopolistic trading position. Later, it was felt that a regime of free trade would make
India a major market for British goods and a source of raw materials, but British
capitalists who invest in India, or who sold banking or shipping service there, contin-
ued effectively to enjoy controlling or dominating privileges. India also provided inter-
esting and lucrative employment for a sizeable portion of the British upper middle
class, and the remittances they sent home made an appreciable contribution to Britain’s
balance of payment and capacity to save. Finally, control of India was a key element
in the world power structure, in terms of geography, logistics and military manpower.
The British were not averse to India economic development if it increased their mar-
kets but refused to help in areas where they felt there was conflict with their own
economic interests or political security. Hence, they refused to give protection to the
Indian textile industry until its main competitor became Japan rather than Manchester,
and they did almost nothing to further technical education. They introduced some
British concepts of property, but did not push them too far when they met interests.

32.2 FORMS OF LEGITIMACY
As you know, immediately before the British rule the Indian sovereignty was lying
with the Mughal dynasty. Till the early nineteenth century the British did not interfere
with the symbols of kingship of the Mughal dynasty. By 1835 Persian remained the
official language and name of the Mughal emperors kept on appearing on coins. The
highest gun salute was reserved for the Mughal dynasty only till 1837. Withdrawal of
these symbols of sovereignty was a symbolic act on the part of the British East India
Company signifying that it had captured the sovereignty of India. The Prior Presence
of the British in the presidency capitals and then in chosen inland locations, meant that
the institutions which were to be the shorthand symbols of the empire would also be
built in this order. Thus the island of Mumbai and some villages of the Hooghly delta
became the grand capitals of the company’s Bombay Presidency, and then the Indian
empire. The advanced, sophisticated heartland of the Mughal Empire became the
provincial interior. The re-inscription of centre and periphery was done with the tools
of a new architecture. New institutions marked a new power. Buildings were the
most corporeal or physical, material, and impressive forms of the new institutions.
What was visible in the capital city, say, in Bombay, was exactly what the provincial
town lacked in the second half of the nineteenth century.
The Company (itself a servant of British crown, running its affair through an Imperial
charter) wanted to make the Indian emperor a subordinate. The terminology of sub-

ordination included ‘paramountcy’, ‘Protection’, ‘subsidiary alliance’, ‘indirect rule’,
‘collaboration’, drawn mainly from British experience in India. By the beginning of
the nineteenth century ‘protection’ arrangements were established through a series
of treaties between the Company and various Indian Princely States. Governor Gen-
eral Lord Wellesely prepared a system which came to be known as Subsidiary Alli-
ance System. This system enlisted in quick succession Hyderabad (1798), the Maratha
Peshwa (1802), the Bhonsle of Nagpur the Scindia of Gualior (1803), Jaipur (1803),
the Gaekwads of Baroda (1805), Travancore (1805), Cochin (1807), Kota (1817),
Jodhpur (1818), Bikaner (1828). The essence of the system was the assurance of the
British protection which the native state paid for by or more of the following means
(a) cost of maintaining a contingent of Company’s troop in cash, (b) cession of the
part of the state’s territory to the Company,(c) partial or complete demilitarization i.e.
doing away with armed force of the state, (d) restriction on relation with other politi-
cal powers and warfare without the Company’s approval, (e) acceptance of the
Company’s Resident at the court to offer advice and instructions.
Once the subjection was achieved through coercion, state practices had to be made
visible to all the subjects. The practices adopted for visibility of the colonial state were
like the trial of the last Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar in his own palace in
1858 or the Delhi Durbar of 1877 when Indian subordination to the British sovereign
was publicly enacted. The symbolic cultural construction of the colonial state for the
common masses was done through the remote agencies of the state and everyday
experiences- the daroga and constabulary; the patel, the amin, the patwari and the
quanungo, in the Collector’s cutchery; the new court of law where unknown people
wearing black gowns, speaking an unknown language (English) taking decisions in
favour of the powerful, the massive colonial monuments making colonial power vis-
ible in the cities, the occasional sights of soldiers coming out of the cantonments on
flag march and ultimately the sight of the native social superior bowing and bending to
members of the white race were few symbols making images of the colonial rule in
the Indian mindset.
32.3 BEGINNING OF THE COLONIAL CONTROL
During the Initial phase of colonial control, indigenous civil administrator was contin-
ued with. This arrangement worked reasonably well before the conquest of Bengal,
but was inefficient as a way of remunerating the officials of a substantial territorial
Empire because (a) too much of the profit went into private hands rather than the
Company’s coffers, and (b) an over greedy short-term policy was damaging to the
productive capacity of the economy and likely to drive the local population to revolt,
both of which were against the Company’s longer-term interests. Clive had operated
a ‘dual’ system, i.e. Company power and a puppet Naweb. Warren Hastings dis-
placed the Nawab and took over direct administration, but retained Indian officials.
32.4 BELIEF IDEOLOGY AND IDEOLOGUES OF COLONIALISM
There was a strong streak of Benthamite radicalism in the East India Company ad-
ministration. James Mill became a senior company official in 1819 after writing a
monumental history of India which showed a strong contempt for Indian institutions.
From 1831 to 1836 he was the Chief Executive Officer of the East India Company
and his son John Stuart Mill worked for the Company from 1823 to 1858. Malthus
was professor of economics at Haileybury, and the teaching there for future company
officials was strongly influenced by Utilitarianism. Bentham himself was also"

consulted on the reform of Indian institutions. The Utilitarians deliberately used India
to try out experiments and ideas (e.g. competitive entry for the civil service) which
they would have liked to apply in England. The Utilitarians were strong supporters of
laissez-faire and hated any kind of state interference to promote economic develop-
ment. Thus, they tended to rely on market forces to deal with famine problems, they
did nothing to stimulate agriculture or protect industry. This laissez-faire tradition was
more deeply embedded in the Indian civil service than in the England itself, and
persisted very strongly until the late 1920s. The administration was efficient and non
corrupt, but the state apparatus was of a watchdog character with few development
spending was for the military, justice, police and jails, and less than 3 per cent for
agriculture. One of the most significant things the British did to Westernize India was
to introduce a modified version of English education. Macaulay’s 1835 Minute on
Education had a decisive impact on British educational policy and is a classic example
of a Western rationalist approach to Indian civilization. Before the British took over,
the Court language of the Mughals was Persian and the Muslim population used
Urdu, a mixture of Persian, Arabic and Sanskrit. Higher education was largely
religious and stressed knowledge of Arabic and Sanskrit. The Company had given
some financial support to a Calcutta Madrassa (1718) and a Sanskrit college at Benares
(1792), Warren Hastings, as governor general from 1782 to 1795 had himself learned
Sanskrit and Persian, and several other Company officials were oriental scholars.
One of them, Sir William Jones, had translated a great mass of Sanskrit literature and
had founded the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1785.
But Macaulay was strongly opposed to this orientalism, “I believe that the present
system tends, not to accelerate the progress of truth, but to delay the natural death of
expiring errors. We are a Board for wasting public money, for printing books which
are less value than the paper in which they are printed was while it was blank; for
giving artificial encouragement to absurd history, absurd metaphysics, absurd physics,
absurd theology ... But I have no knowledge of either Sanskrit or Arabic … But I
have done what I could to form a correct estimate of their value … Who could deny
that a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of
India and Arabic ... all the historical information which has been collected from all the
books written in the Sanskrit language is less valuable than what may be found in the
most paltry abridgements used at preparatory schools in England”.
For these reasons Macaulay had no hesitation in  deciding in favour of English education,
but it was not to be for the masses, “It is impossible for us, with our limited means to
attempt to educate the body of the people. We must at present do our best to form a class
who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern; a class of persons,
Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in mind. To that
class we may leave it to refine the local dialects of the country, to enrich those dialects with
terms of science borrowed from the Western name, and to render them by degrees, fit
vehicles for conveying knowledge to the great mass of the population”.

32.5 THE COLONIAL APPARATUS
In 1785, Cornwallis created a professional cadre of Company servants who had gen-
erous salaries, had no private trading or production interests in India, enjoyed the
prospect of regular promotion and were entitled to pensions. All high-level posts were
reserved for the British , and Indians were excluded. Cornwallis appointed British
judges, and established British officials as revenue collectors and magistrates in each
district of Bengal. From 1806 the Company trained its young recruits in Haileybury
College near London. Appointments were still organized on a system of patronage,
but after 1833 the Company selected amongst its nominated candidates by competi-
tive examination. After 1853, selection was entirely on merit and the examination was
thrown open to any British candidate. The examination system was influenced by the
Chinese model, which had worked well for 2,000 years and had a similar emphasis on
classical learning and literary competence. The Indian civil service (i) was very highly
paid; (ii) it enjoyed political power which no bureaucrat could have had in England.
In 1829 the system was strengthened by establishing districts throughout British India
small enough to be effectively controlled by an individual British official who hence-
forth exercised a completely autocratic power, acting as revenue collector, judge and
chief of police (functions which had been separate under the Mughal administration).
This arrangement later became the cornerstone of imperial administration throughout
the British Empire. As the civil service was ultimately subject to the control of the
British parliament, and the British community in India was subject to close mutual
surveillance, the administration was virtually incorruptible.
The army of the Company was a local mercenary force with 20,000- 30,000 British
officers and troops. It was by far the most modern and efficient army in Asia. After
the Mutiny in 1857, the size of the British contingent was raised to a third of the total

strength and all officers were British until the 1920s when a very small number of
Indians were recruited. Normally, the total strength of the army was about 200,000.
this army was very much smaller than those of Mughal India, but had better training
and equipment, and the railway network (which was constructed partly for military
reasons) gave it greater mobility, better logistics and intelligence.
The higher ranks of the administration remained almost entirely British until the 1920s
when the Indian Civil Services Examinations began to be held in India as well as
England. In addition, there was a whole hierarchy of separate bureaucracies in which
the higher rank were British, i.e. the revenue, justice, police, education, medical,
public works, engineering, postal and railway services as well as provincial civil
services, India thus offered highly-paid careers to an appreciable portion of the
British middle and upper classes (particularly for its peripheral members from
Scotland and Ireland).
From the 1820s to the 1850s the British demonstrated a strong urge to change Indian
social institutions, and to westernize India. They stamped out infant killing and ritual
burning of widows (sati). They abolished slavery and eliminated dacoits (religious
thugs) from the highways. They legalized the remarriage of widows and allowed
Hindu converts to Christianity to lay claim to their share of joint family property. They
took steps to introduce a penal code ( the code was actually introduced in 1861) based
in British law, which helped inculcate some ideas of equality. Under the new law,
Brahmin and Sudra were liable to the same punishment for the same offence. Thus
rule of law and equality before law were the new norms.
Until 1857 it was possible to entertain the view that the British may eventually destroy
traditional Indian society and westernize the country. But activist Westernizing poli-
cies and the attempt to extend British rule by taking over native states rulers had left
no heirs provokes sections of both the Hindu and Muslim communities into rebellion in
the Mutiny of 1857. Although the Mutiny was successfully put down with substantial
help from loyal Indian troops including the recently conquered Sikhs, British policy
towards Indian institutions and society became much more conservative. The Crown
took over direct responsibility and the East India Company was disbanded. The In-
dian Civil Service attracted fewer people with innovating ideas than had the East
India Company and was more closely controlled from London.
The British forged an alliance with the remaining native princes and stopped taking
over new territory. Until the end of their rule about a quarter of the Indian population
remained in quasi autonomous native states. These had official British residents but
were fairly free in internal policy, and the effort of westernization came to a standstill.
The education system which developed was a very pale reflection of that in the
United Kingdom. Three universities were set up in 1857 in Calcutta, Madras and
Bombay, but they were merely examining bodies and did no teaching. Higher educa-
tion was carried out in affiliated colleges which gave a two-year B.A. course with
heavy emphasis on rote learning and examinations. Drop-out ratios were always very
high. They did little to promote analytic capacity or independent thinking and pro-
duced a group of graduates with a half-baked knowledge of English, but sufficiently
westernized to be alienated from their own culture. It was not until the 1920s that
Indian universities provided teaching facilities and then only for M.A. student. Fur-
thermore, Indian education was of a predominantly literacy character and the provi-
sion for technical training was much less than in any European country. Education for"

girls was almost totally ignored throughout the nineteenth century. Because higher
education was in English, there was no official effort to translate western literature
into the local nor was there any standardization of Indian scripts whose variety is a
major barrier to multi-lingualism amongst educated Indians.
Primary education was not taken very seriously as government obligation and was
financed largely by the weak local authorities. As a result, the great mass of the
population had no access to education and, at independence in 1947, 88 per cent were
illiterate. Progress was accelerated from the 1930s onwards, but at independence
only a fifth of children were receiving any primary schooling. Education could have
played a major role in encouraging social mobility, eliminating religious superstition,
increasing productivity, and uplifting the status of women. In stead it was used to turn
tiny elite into imitation Englishmen and somewhat bigger group into government clerks.
32.6 CHANGES UNDER COLONIAL STATE
The main changes which the British made in Indian society were at the top. They
replaced the wasteful warlord nobility by a bureaucratic-military establishment, care-
fully designed by practical technocrats, which was very efficient in maintaining law
and order. The greater efficiency of government permitted a great reduction in the
fiscal burden, and a biggest share of the national product was available for landlords,
capitalists and the new professional classes. Some of this upper class income was
sent off to the United Kingdom, but the bulk was spent in India. However, the pattern
of consumption changed as the new upper class no longer kept harems and palaces,
nor did they wear fine muslins and well decorated swords. This caused some painful
readjustments in the traditional handicraft sector. Government itself carried out pro-
ductive investment in railways and irrigation and as a result there was a growth in
both agricultural and industrial output. The new elite established a western life-style
using the English language and English schools. New towns and urban amenities
were created with segregated suburbs and housing for them. Their habits were cop-
ied by the new professional elite of lawyers, doctors, teachers, journalists and busi-
nessmen. Within this group, old caste barriers were eased and social mobility in-
creased. As far as the mass of the population were concerned, colonial rule brought
few significant changes. The British educational effort was very limited. There were
no major changes in village society, in the caste system, the position of untouchables,
the joint family system, or in the production techniques in agriculture. British impact
on economic and social development was, therefore, limited. Total output and popula-
tion increased substantially but the gain in per capita output was small or negligible.

The British state in India developed its own ethos. The British did not intermarry or
eat with the lower (native) classes. The state was maintained not just through the
conquests and alliances but also through the development of new institutions which
symbolically made the sahibs distinct from the natives. The small creole class of
Anglo-Indian were outcastes unable to integrate into Indian or local British society.
The British kept to their clubs and bungalows in special suburbs known as canton-
ments and civil lines. They maintained the Mughal tradition of official pomp, large
residences, and a large number of servants. The elite with its classical education and
contempt for business were quite happy establishing law order, and keeping ‘barbar-
ians’ at bay on the frontier of the raj. They developed their own brand of self-righ-
teous arrogance, considering themselves suppliers not of popular but of good govern-
ment. For them the word ‘British’ lost its geographic association and became a nick-
name signifying moral decency to govern the colony of India.

according to their ideas of what a colonial state could be. In a modern state, the
colonial governments had a monopoly of force, a central administrative and clearly
defined territorial boundaries.
During the 19th century, British royal or imperial ideology emerged in which the Brit-
ish, as the wealthiest and progressive nation in the world, had a duty to help the rest of
the world to proper and improve. The main responsibilities of imperial government
were run as collecting level resume and execution of legal administration.
Once the subjection was achievers through coercion, state practices had to be made
visible to all the subjects. During the initial plane of colonial control, indigenous civil
administration was continued with.
In 1785, Cornwallis created a professional code of Company servants. All high leave
parts were removed for the British and Indian were enclosed. They army of the
Company was local mercenary force with 20,00-30,000 British officers and troops
The high rank of the administration remained almost entirely British until the 1920s
when the India Civil Service Examinations a strong age to change Indian social institu-
tions and to westernize India. They sampled out import killing, ritual burning of widows
(sati), legalized the remarriage of widows and allowed Hindu converts to Christianity.
Besides three universities were set up in 1857 in Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay.
The British kept to their clubs and banglows in special suburbs known as contain-
ments and civil lines. However, there were no major changes in village society, in
caste system, the position of untouchables, the joint family system or in the production
techniques in agriculture."

Notes
Suppose you woke up one morning to find yourself in estrange land, where people
speak a language you do not understand, wear different clothes, eat food you are
not used to. You would probably find it impossible to survive unless you learned
their ways of behaviour. These ways of behaviour, along with many other things, go
into the making of our culture.
As you will see, all of us are born into cultures. This may differ according to our
region, religion and caste or class. As we grow, each one of us absorbs dozens of
cultural practices almost automatically. Many of these practices have been handed
down for generations, some of these for centuries, and some are even millennia old
traditions. At the same time, cultural practices are subject to change. In this lesson,
we will explore our relationship to culture.
OBJECTIVES
After studying this lesson,  you will be able to:
• define culture;
• analyse how culture is shaped;
• explain cultural interaction and
• critically analyze phenomenon of globalisation.
29.1 WHAT DO WE MEAN BY CULTURE
Forms of Cultural Expression
When we hear or see a cultural programme either on radio or TV or on stage, this
usually includes music, songs and dance. Each of these is a form of cultural expres-
sion. Each such form communicates a message. A sculpture of the Buddha in
meditation for instance, may be meant to encourage feelings of peace and tranquility
(Fig.29.1). A folk/story may teach and entertain, whereas a towering monument like
the Qutab Minar may tell us with awe (Fig.29.2). In other words, culture can be used
to transmit a variety of ideas. We will see more examples of this in Lesson No.31."

 CONTEMPORARY CULTURAL SITUATION
We have a wide range of cultural forms in India. These include sculpture, archi-
tecture literature, painting and music to name a few. There is an immense variety
within each of these. For example, if we think of songs, we can immediately think
of so many types: folk songs, film songs, bhajans, qawwalis. etc. Each type is
usually sung on a special occasion, and has a special purpose. At the same time,
you may have noticed that some film songs are in fact bhajans or set to folk tunes.
In what ways do you think that a bhajan in a film is different from that sung by
devotees in a temple?
29.2 POPULAR OR FOLK CULTURE
Common people have developed rich cultural traditions which are often called popu-
lar, literally of the people. People have expressed themselves and communicated
cultural values through song, dance and storytelling. All of these go into the making of
folk culture.
Given their limited material resources, common people cannot build grand
monuments, but they create and use countless smaller objects which are extremely
beautiful. While some of these objects are used for routine activities, other are

reserved for special occasions. Unfortunately, most of the material used is perish-
able, such as cane, cloth, wood, leaves or earthenware. As such, these objects do
not last very long. So we know much less about the cultures of common people
from ancient times (Fig 29.3).
29.3 CLASSICAL CULTURE
Dance forms such as Bharat Natyam are often referred to as classical. This means that
it is one of the finest forms of artistic expression. Similarly Kalidasa is regarded as an
example of a classical Sanskrit poet, The temples built by the Cholas are regarded as
examples of classical temple architecture, as is the Taj Mahal of Mughal architecture
(Fig.29.4)
We can justly be proud of these achievements. However, we need to remember that
at the time when Kalidasa wrote (c 4th century AD) most people in north and central
India spoke various forms of Prakrit (from which many modern Indian languages have
developed). While they would have followed the Prakrit portions of Kalidasas plays,
they would not have been able to understand his Sanskrit Verses. Similarly, common
people would have found it difficult to enter the exquisite monuments we have just
mentioned. Entry may have been restricted on grounds of caste or religion.
As such, classical culture tends to be highly developed but exclusive. It is only since
the last two centuries or so that many Sanskrit works have been translated into
regional languages, and monuments have been thrown open to a wider public.
Folk and classical cultures have co-existed and interacted for centuries. They have
borrowed and adapted ideas from each other.
How Anthropologists Define Culture
Anthropology literally means the study of human beings. Cultural and social
anthropologists study present-day societies, including rituals, beliefs, social customs,
work patterns etc. So, When anthropologists write about culture they include some
or all of these aspects.

The Archaeologist And Culture
When often feel that we have something in common with those who eat and
dress like us, whereas we tend to treat those who eat and dress differently as
belonging to a different culture. This definition of culture is very similar to that
used by the archaeologist. An archaeologist studies houses, tools, pots,
statues, etc and tries to reconstruct how people lived in the past. Because all
these objects can be seen and touched, and are more or less permanent they
are regarded as part of our material culture. You will learn more about the
production of some aspects of our material culture in next lesson (30).
While clothes and food are also part of our material culture, they decay very
fast. As such, while archaeologists do often recover traces of food and clothes
used in earlier times, these are generally fewer than those of things such as
utensils, tools or weapons.
We can see then that culture can be defined in many ways:
(a) as forms of cultural expression (e.g. song, dance, music, painting, sculp-
ture, architecture, etc.)
(b) in terms of the social group which produces or uses a cultural form (e.g.
popular/folk, classical/elite)
(c) broader definitions in terms of aspects of social, religious and material
life.
Have you noticed how these definitions overlap? Look at the picture of this
house (Fig.29.5). In terms of its form we would classify it as an example of
architecture (as opposed to sculpture or music). It is also, at the same time, an
example of folk or popular culture, as it is a part of the material culture of those
who build and live in it.

India mentioned above, and those at Dilwara (Rajasthan), as well as the Jama Masjid,
Delhi (illustrations) are outstanding examples of beautiful structures created for
religious purposes.
Religion has, through the ages, also inspired some of our best poetry and music.
These include Vedic chants, the compositions of Buddhist monks and nuns, and
perhaps most well-known, the compositions of Bhakti and Sufi saints.
Tamil Nadu has had a rich and continuous tradition of V aishnava and Shaiva
devotional literature, which includes the compositions of women like Andal. One of
the earliest and best-known Kashmiri poets was Lai Ded, a woman saint of the
fourteenth century.
Today, medieval saint-composers such as Mira Bai, Guru Nanak and Kabir are
revered not only in their own regions but throughout India. Many saints belonged to
low castes and used the language of common people. Their compositions, part of
our popular culture, have been transmitted orally for centuries.
Our religious beliefs also influences our daily lives. Sometimes, marriage rituals, the
food we eat, and the clothese we wear are governed by religious rules. But, more
often, what we eat and wear, or our marriage customs, “vary according to regions
rather than according to religion. To take a simple example. Hindu Muslim Christian
and Sikh wornd in Punjab–generally wear salwar kameej, whereas Hindu, Mus-
lim and Christian women in Tamil Nadu usually wear saris. So while our religious
beliefs do shape our cultural practices, they are not the only influence.

29.5 OUR SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION
Many of our cultural practices are influenced by our social and economic situation.
For example, our social situation may influence what we wear. You may have
noticed that many women are required to dress differently, depending on whether
they are unmarried, or widowed.
Sometimes, our cultural practices may be influenced by both our social and our
economic situation. This includes such things as our tastes and preferences in
music-whether we like folk songs, film songs, classical music or western pop
music. While we can learn Hindi film songs quickly from the radio, for example,
learning classical music is far more difficult and expensive. It also takes much
longer, and many of us might find it difficult to spare time for it.
The cultural objects we produce and use are also often limited by our economic re-
sources. None of us would have been able to build the Taj Mahal even if we had wanted
to. This was only possible for Shah Jahan, the ruler of a large and prosperous empire.
Fig 29.8 Jama Masjid
Shah Jahan began the construction of the Taj Mahal in 1632, in memory of his
wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It took about twenty two years to build the monument, with
as many as twenty thousand labourers working daily during the earlier/stages. The
cost of construction was forty million rupees, an enormous sum in those days.

In fact, most of the splendid forts, palaces, and religious monuments we see (illus-
tration, Jodhpur/Jaipur) were built by rulers. Apart from serving as royal residences
or places of worship, they were also meant to proclaim the power and glory of
those when got them built. However, although material resources are important,
they are not always decisive. Mira Bai left the wealth and splendour of the palace of
Chittor to embrace a life of homelessness and freedom to pursue her spiritual goals.
Today we remember her songs and not her husband.

29.6 CULTURAL INTERACTION
Our culture is often shaped through a process of interaction. This happens when
people with different cultural traditions come into contact with one another. Such
contact can take place through the expeditions and voyages of merchants or
traders, or when conquerors invade a country. It also occurs when pilgrims or trav-
ellers visit distant lands, and when craftsmen and labouring women and men travel
from place to place in search of employment.
Those involved in such interactions learn about the practice of different peoples,
and carry their own ideas and customs to new lands. In the process, the cultural
practices of all those who participate in such interaction tends to change.
Let us take the example of food. Did you know that vegetables like the potato and
tomato were introduced to India about five hundred years ago by Portuguese trad-
ers and soliders who brought them from central America, and that tea has come
from China? Other food items, such as rice and the dals we use, oilseeds like mus-
tard and sesame, have been cultivated in India for over five thousand years.
If you look at what we eat today, you will notice that it is a mixture of foods which
have been traditionally available, as well as more recent additions. At the same time,
people in other parts of the world, such as the USA and Great Britain, have devel-
oped taste for Indian cuisine, especially curries and kababs. You will come across
more examples of cultural interaction and its effects in the lessons which follow."

 29.7 GLOBALISATION
The process whereby the entire world is being brought under a single economic and
cultural network is often referred to as globalisation, (from the word globe)
29.8 WHAT IS A GLOBAL VILLAGE
You may have heard the expression global village. At first sight it may appear to
be contradictory. How can something which is global or worldwide be a village at
the same time?
The phrase global village was used for the first time by a scholar named Mc–Luhan.
He felt that with the increased use of television, communication would change

 CONTEMPORARY CULTURAL SITUATION
dramatically This meant that people would be able to send messages across
thousands of miles almost instantly. As a result, physical distance would no longer
appear as a barrier, preventing or slowing down communication.
Over the last few decades, and especially in the last ten years, the vast TV networks
which have emerged through the use of satellites and other powerful technological
devices might make us  believe that Mc-Luhan’s prediction has come true. Sitting in
India, we can watch Nelson Mandela taking over as president of South Africa, or a
cricket match in Sharjah. But then we may ask are the differences amongst people
only those of physical distance?
While most people who live together in a village are farmers, there are obvious
differences amongst rich landlords, small farmers, tenant cultivatiors, craftsmen, and
landless agricultural labourers. In other words, people can be close to one another
in physical terms, but be separated by social and economic distance. As the land-
lord are more powerful they tend to dominate social, economic and cultural interac-
tion in the village. So although communication may be direct, and face-to-face, it is
at the same time influenced by the fact that those who participate in it are not equal
in status.
This problem is aggravated even more in the global village. Here communication is
dominated by people in cities. You may have noticed that on the average, city-
dwellers are richer and more influential than those who live in villages. We can go a
step further and distinguish between cities in developing countries like India, and
those in developed countries like the USA. People living in the latter are generally
richer than those living in Indian cities, and it is usually powerful people in these
cities of the developed countries who produce and beam out TV programmes,
which we then receive.
What happens in the global village is that although distances are overcome, commu-
nication becomes a one-day process. We can see and hear what is presented by
the TV producers, but there is no genuine dialogue. So unlike face-to-face conver-
sation in a small village, where we can discuss, interrupt, quarrel and make up, we
simply receive the messages which flow to us from TV and often follow them. It is
much more difficult to question or challenge what we are told.
29.9 ADVERTISING AND CONSUMERISM
Consider the programmes we listen to on radio, or watch on TV-news, films, talk
shows. programmes on science, music, history, sports-the variety seems infinite.
However, no matter what we might choose to watch, we also see dozens if not
hundreds of advertisements. Why is this so? This is because advertisers or spon-
sors pay for the programmes we see. They are usually carefully to choose
programmes which are popular, so that they can reach out to a wide audience. They
can then advertise their products to millions of people.
What the advertisers hope is that while watching our favourite TV shows we will
notice their products and be tempted to try out. In other words, they get an"

opportunity to persuade us to buy their brands or products, no matter what soaps,
creams, cars, household appliances the list is endless. This tendency to buy things
beyond our immediate and basic requirements and occasionally beyond our means is
known as consumerism.
Thus, while distances have indeed been bridged dramatically, the new technology is
used to the advantage of big manufacturers including multinational companies. They
create a large population of consumers who are persuaded to spend what they
earn, or even borrow to buy various “objects of desire”.
As it works at present, globalisation usually serves the interests of rich industrialists
more than anything else. For globalisation to be truly beneficial it will have to de-
velop into an interaction based on respect for cultural diversity and a sharing of the
world’s resources rather than their concentration in the hands of a few.
We also need to remember that the potential benefits of globalisation cannot be
ignored. Even as we are persuaded to buy foreign products through TV programmes,
we also learn about other cultures. We have to decide what is worth accepting and
what can be rejected. Globalisation is something we now live with. We must under-
stand that we can do so on our own terms.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 29.4

1. Globalisation is taking place in the spheres of the  and cultural
communication.
2. The   phrase was coined by McLuhan.
3. Advertisers  TV programmers.

WHAT YOU HA VE LEARNT
Culture is an integral part of human existence. There are many forms of cultural
expression. Forms which are produced by or for common people are known as
popular, whereas more exclusive forms are known as classical culture includes our
social customs as well as objects such as clothes or food which we use in our daily
lives. Our cultural practices are often influenced by our religious beliefs and our
social and economic condition. They are also shaped through interaction amongst
people. In the present-day situation, globalisation represents one specific form of
interaction. This is a mixed blessing. It often leads to consumerism. This is encour-
aged by manufactures who advertise their products. At the same time, globalization
is a beneficial force as it helps us communicate across great distances. And facili-
tates the exchange of all kinds of ideas and information."

In this section we shall try to understand about our artists and their paintings-what did
they paint what did they paint with and for whom did they paint?
In the past arts and crafts were a part of everyday life and what was useful was also
beautiful. The pots and pans our ancestors used, the clothes they wore and the homes they
lived in had different kinds of designs on them. (Fig 30.1)

 CULTURAL PRODUCTION
The most exquisite designs were produced by women on the threshold of their homes
with rice flour, turmeric (haldi) and vermilion (kumkum) powders. The Madhubani
paintings originated in one such rural tradition in Bihar where scenes from the life of
Krishna were reproduced on the walls, on paper or any other medium during the
Janmashtami (Lord Krishna’s birthday) festival as well as other festive occasions
these instances art had a ritual purpose and was considered auspicious.
The earliest paintings which have come down to us are the cave paintings created by
hunting and gathering tribes. Some of the best known of these are to be found in the
caves and rock shelters of Mirzapur and Banda in Uttar Pradesh, Bhimbetka near
Bhopal and Singanpur near Raigarh, in Madhya Pradesh, the Mahadav hills of the
Vindhya ranges and Bellary in Karnataka. These paintings are usually hunting scenes
which give us an idea of the vegetation and animal life of the area and the nature of
tools used by early men and women. These were simple tools like the bow and arrow
or axes. We do not know exactly why these paintings were made but it is possible that
they had some magical significance and were meant to ensure success in the hunt.
While early men and women made these paintings for their own needs, in later times
paintings were usually produced under royal patronage which means that kings paid
and sometimes maintained the painter in order to get them made.
The earliest of these are found at the famous caves of Bagh (in Madhya Pradesh)
and of Ellora and Ajanta (in Maharashtra). The themes in Ajanta are drawn from the
life of the Buddha, especially depictions from the Jataka stories which record the
many lives of the Buddha. You will be learning more about Buddhism in the lesson
No.31. There are also some scenes from every day life such as the famous depiction
from the Ajanta caves of the princess engaged in her makeup. The arts of Ajanta and
Ellora were patronized by the Gupta and Vakataka rulers and who belonged roughly
to the period from the fourth to sixth centuries. These paintings are remarkable for
their unfading colours. It is believed that the Mahabalipuram cave art of the time of
the Pallava kings who ruled between the sixth and tenth centuries, were inspired by
the artistic techniques employed in the Ajanta and Ellora paintings.
The rock cut temples of Mahabalipuram (located just outside Chennai) belong
to the period of Mamallan Narasimha Pallavan who ruled in the seventh cen-
tury. Here beautiful paintings and sculputres depicting scenes from the
Mahabharata, are found in the interior of caves and on rock surfaces.
The origin of paintings as art objects was a development that happened in royal courts
and in towns and cities. Among such traditions we can count the Mughal miniatures.
The Mughal paintings (produced between the 16th and 18th centuries) were often
times a pleasing blend of Safawid and Hindostani traditions. The Mughal and Rajput
painters despite their distinctive styles also inspired each other. Book binding and manu-
script illustrations were two associated art which sprang up around the same time. The
lavishly illustrated Padshahnama is a good example of the skill Persian craftsmen
possessed in the art of manuscript illustration. Other famous illustrated manuscripts
include the Akbarnama. Both are biographies of kings celebrating their achievements.
Another example is the illustrated Jain manuscripts. These manuscripts begin to
appear from the sixth century A.D. onwards. The Jains decided to preserve their"

ancient knowledge by writing it down. In some cases merchants paid artists to pre-
pare the manuscripts. These manuscripts were beautifully illustrated through minia-
tures. It is believed that the first Tirthankara Rishabhadeva was himself a skilled
painter. Among the early illustrated Jain manuscripts is: Ashtasahasrika Prajnana
Paramita. The best known miniature paintings on Jain religion and philosophy is the
Trilokya Dipika.
The early paintings were leisurely works of art while some modern artistic works are
done at a fast pace to meet immediate requirements. For example hoardings and
posters advertising films are meant to catch the attention of the public and are changed
every week. Unlike early paintings these hoardings have a short life since they are
frequently replaced.

 30.2 INDIAN TEXTILES AND COSTUMES
Geographical and climatic factors have greatly influenced the clothing of the Indian people.
While in northern India people use both woolen and cotton clothes, in southern India which
has a warm climate people wear only cotton. The clothing of men in the warm regions
consists of an upper cloth and a lower cloth of roughly one and a half yards. In northern
India men also wear a stitched shirt called kurta and trousers known as pyjama. The
women may “either wear a six yard unstitched cloth called sari or may wear stitched
garments similar to what the men wear called kurta and salwar. The wearing of the sari
depends on the cultural, traditions of different regions. For example the Maharashtrian and
Tamilian women wear a nine yard sari with a separator between the legs while the women
of Kerala wear a four or five yard sari just up to the ankles.
It is believed that costumes in early India consisted of unstitched cloth. It is diffi-
cult to tell when Indians first began to wear stitched clothes but some of the
paintings and sculptures dating back to the early Christian era show Kushana
guards and soldiers wearing trousers and jackets. This may have been the result
of Greek influence. In ancient sculptures such as the ones at Amaravati (in Andhra
Pradesh) or Brahadisvaram (in Tamil Nadu), it is only the serving classes and
dancing girls who are depicted in stitched garments and not the kings or the gods."

 CULTURAL PRODUCTION

The production of cotton in India goes back to pre-historic times. We have definite
evidence for the use of cotton from Mohenjodaro one of the largest cities of the
Harappa civilization. Spindals have been found by archaeologists. The earliest literary
reference to the loom on “which cloth is woven, comes from the Atharva Veda.
Spinning was the work of women especially widows and unmarried women.
Indian textiles reflect culture. Everything is important- the colours chosen, the designs
and the occasion it is worn. Red represents fertility and is generally worn by the bride
on the occasion of her wedding. Ochre and white represent purity and sacrifice and
are usually worn by spiritual persons and also by widows. Black is considered inaus-
picious although in south India pregnant women wear black perhaps to ward off the
evil eye. Colouring was traditionally done with vegetable dyes such as indigo and
madder although now most dyers have switched over to cheaper chemical dyes.
The earliest designs on textiles were geometrical. The depiction of certain types of
plants and animals on textiles from different regions gives us an idea of what those
people were familiar with and also regarded as auspicious. The lotus or the kalka
(mango) designs are popular in most parts of India. India produces a rich variety of
textiles. The brocaded silks of Varanasi called Jamdani and Jamewar, the gold bor-
dered silks of Kanchipuram and the tassore of Assam, Birigal and Karnataka consti-
tute well known varieties of silk- Cotton textiles can be woven on simple horizontal
looms while brocaded silks required more complex looms with multiple pedals. Silks
are more expensive than cottons and can be afforded only by a few.
Different types of textiles require different production techniques. The textile called
tie and dye’ and known within different cultural traditions as bandhini (Rajasthan and
Gujarat), ikat (Orissa) or chungdi (Tamil Nadu) is produced by a process in which the
cloth and sometimes the yarn is tied and dyed.
The kalamkari textiles constitute a living tradition in Andhra. Literally the term
‘kalamkari’ means wording (lean) with the pen kalam). The painters were patronized
by the Deccani Sultanates (from the fourteenth to the seventeenth centuries) and the
nobility. The themes depicted constitute a blend of Islamic and Hindu motifs. Interest-
ingly, what is sold today as ‘kalamkari’ are machine made, block-printed textiles! In
fact much of the cloth that is produced these days is done on the power loom.

30.3 LITERATURE
We shall now look at our rich and varied literatures which range from epics to folk
songs, from classical to popular texts.
India is a land where many languages are spoken. There are as many as 325 lan-
guages dialects spoken in India, for eg. While Hindi is the main language in Uttar
Pradesh, the people of this state speak in as many as eighty five dialects which are
regional variations of Hindi.
Our literature is both religious as well as nonreligious in content, dealing with themes
from the life of the people or the court. The Vedas written in Sanskrit form a part of
our religious literature while texts like the Mrichakatika literally The Story of the Toy
Can’ of Shudraka deal with worldly themes.
A rich range of regional variations exists especially in the re-telling of our major epics
- the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. It is well known that while Valmiki wrote the
Ramayana known as the ‘Adi Kavya’ in Sanskrit, Tulsidas wrote the Hindi version
which is popularly known as Ramcharitamanas. The court poet of the Cholas called
Kamban wrote the Ramayana in Tamil while the popular folk version of the Ramayana
in Telugu was written by a peasant woman called Molla.
It is interesting that even the style of writing the text is influenced by the social situa-
tion of the writer. For example while Kamban uses the language and imagery of the
elite ruling class Molla writes like a peasant woman and in describing the sunset she
says that the sun went down the sky like a worker tired after the day’s labours.
We shall now briefly look at some of the regional and folk variations of the Mahabharata
which is believed to have been authored by the sage Veda Vyasa in Sanskrit. In a
Telugu version of the Mahabharata it is said that after the Pandavas led by Yudhishthira
lost their Property and freedom in the game of dice to Duryodhana Draupadi
exercised her right to participate in the dice game. To show her contempt for her
opponent she threw the dice with her foot and began to win back whatever her
husbands had lost. Daupadi is worshipped as a deity in many parts of south India.
A Tamil version of the Mahabharata refers to a Pandyan queen called Alirani who
hated man and ruled only with the aid of women. It is said that she conquered Arjuna
in battle, and later married him. Bhima is the central figure in the Mahabharata stories
from the Himalayan region. He and his tribal wife Hidimaba are primary deities in the
region of Mandi in Himachal Pradesh. The practice of polyandry still exists following
the Mahabharata tradition in which Draupadi is married to the five Pandava brothers.
In the Chattisgarh version of the Mahabharata called Pandavani’, Bhima is again the
central character. Many tribal communities of the north-east claim to be directly de-
scended from Bhima and Hidimba. For example the Darrang Kachari of Dimapur
describe themselves as Bhim-ni-fa’, i.e. the children of Bhima1.
Although many events and characters are identifiable with northern India, the
Mahabharata has a rich tradition which spreads across the length and breadth of the"

the people. These range from classical narrations to folk ballads.

30.4 THE CULTURE OF FOOD
Let us now take a look at our food habits.. We shall see how widely they differ from
region to region and the ways in which, over a period of time, our food habits have
changed due to interaction.
The food habits of Indians varies depending on the nature of crops grown in differ-
ent regions, the cultural practices of different communities and the economic and
social status of the consuming class/community or individuals. While wheat is the
staple diet of the Indo-Gangetic belt, consumed mainly in the form of rice is the
staple food of south Indians because very little wheat is grown in the regions south
of the Vindhya mountains.
We know something of the food eaten by our ancestors through the archaeological
evidence of food grains. Habitation sites, where people had actually lived, have pro-
duced evidence of wheat (for example the new Stone Age site of Mehrgarh in
Baluchistan) or the evidence of rice, ragi and horsegram especially in the southern
sites like Brahmagiri and Hallur in Karnatakas, Piklihal in Andhra Pradesh and
Paiyampalli in Tamil Nadu. Evidence from Piklihal suggests that the people here were
herders who domesticated cattle, sheep and goats.
Pots were used for storing water and grain as well as for cooking. Indian archaeolo-
gists have classified ancient cultures on the basis of the pottery they produced such as
the Painted Grey Ware, Black Polished pottery etc. Bronze age archaeological sites
like Adichanallur in Tamil Nadu have also produced bronze and gold vessels. These,
more obviously used by the rich.
Most regions have their own distinctive cuisine. The southern states like Andhra
Pradesh. Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu are rice-based cultures. Idli, Dosa and
Upma prepared by south Indians have now gained popularity in northern India and the
easy availability of the these dishes in north Indian states is a proof of the interaction
between different communities. Kerala like West Bengal which also has a coastal
culture, is known for its fish preparations."

With the coming of the Mughals, ‘Mughlai’ dishes like the tandoori chicken and seekh
kababs along with fruits like the water melon, became a part of Indian cuisine. Awadhi
(Awadh refers to the region of eastern UP) cuisine today is reflective of Mughal
Nawabi culture. In the sixteenth century the Europeans, especially the Portuguese
introduced potatoes, tomatoes and green chillies into Indian food which is now an
indispensable part of our cooking. French beans also became a part of Indian cuisine
during this period. Thus, cultural interaction has led to changes in our food habits.
An ordinary meal in a family may consist of rice or roti, dal i.e. lentils and a vegetable
preparation. While the daily meals are usually prepared by women at home cooking
on a large scale is generally done by men. There are many poor people in India who
can only afford to eat gruel. The rich may eat a variety of foods consisting of both
vegetarian and meat dishes, meat being much more expensive than vegetables. On
special occasions like marriages all communities prepare a feast of a number of dishes
having the distinct flavour of their region.

WHAT YOU HA VE LEARNT
We have looked at forms of cultural production and the regional variations as well as
the nature of cultural interaction in terms of our clothing or food habits. We have seen
that our early ancestors produced objects such as pottery which were useful as well
as beautiful. However in later times art objects like paintings began to be produced
under royal patronage.
We also noticed that people wore clothing according to climatic requirements and that
costumes varied from region to region. We have learnt about textile varieties, designs
and some special types like the kalamkari and the chungdi. In the section on literature
we saw that the wide range of Indian languages has contributed to the richness of our
literature. Here we have noted some of the regional and folk variations of the"

Notes
When you were younger, you grandparents must have told you stories about kings
and queens, magical events, animals and birds and other tales of long ago. Many of
these stories are drawn from epics and religious texts like the Ramayana or the Bible,
or from collections of stories like the Panchatantra or the Arabian Nights. Through
these stories, all of us have absorbed many aspects of our cultural heritage. Culture is
communicated through various means- oral, written through music, and nowadays,
via film and television too.
OBJECTIVES
• after studying this lesson you will be able to;
• explain how speech writing & printing help cultural communication;
• list some methods of cultural communication;
• describe how music is used to communicate different ideas and
• explain how a variety of cultural forms were used to spread Buddhism.
31.1 HOW CULTURE IS COMMUNICATED
Can you imagine a world without language? Language is a basic characteristic of
human society. It is not only a means for people to understand each other, but is also
a vehicle for the transmission of cultural ideas. A shared language knits people to-
gether, but also distinguishes them from one another. For the people of Punjab are
bound together by their common language, Punjabi, but are also differentiated from
those whose mother tongue is not Punjabi. Did you know that Punjabi is one of the
two most widely spoken languages in Pakistan also?
Another language in the subcontinent which is shared by people of different
countries is Bengali.
The spread of language and culture is influenced by geographical factors. People
living in near by areas usually speak the same or similar languages. Those who
live thousands of miles apart have very different mother tongues. This is because"

 CULTURAL COMMUNICATION
communication between far flung areas was difficult before modern means of
transport developed. Cultures tended to evolve in relative isolation and ended up
being very distinct.
Communication is still difficult in densely forested and mountainous areas. A tribe
living on one face of a hill or a valley may not even know of another tribe living on
another hillside just a few kilometers away. The language they speak can therefore
by very different.
However, in areas like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar where vast plains are well connected
by rivers, people could travel easily even in ancient times. So similar languages and
customs developed due to regular interaction.
Even where one language such as Hindi or Tamil is spoken over a large area, there
are veriations from district to district. No version is sufficiently different to be called
a language, so they are called dialects of a language.
Spoken language was and remain one of the most important means of communica-
tion. However the invention of writing widened the scope of communication.
Messages could henceforth be sent over long distances and preserved over time.
Writing was known in India over 4000 years ago. This was the Harappan script which
has not been deciphered yet. With the decline of the Harappan civilization around
1800 BC, writing was also lost. The knowledge of writing reappeared around the 3rd
century BC. This writing called Brahmi is the mother of all modern Indian scripts.
Initially, rulers and wealthy people had important documents engraved on rock
surfaces, stone tablets and copper plates. Cloth leather, the bark of the tree called
bhojapatra and palm leaf called talapatra were used for writing on.
What kind of books do you think there were in earlier times? There were religious
texts which were used by priests. Law books, called Shastras were written for the
use of kings and their ministers. Drama and poetry were composed for the enjoyment
of the wealthy. It in clear that most books were therefore meant only for a small
number of privileged people.
However, there were also epics like the Mahabharata (about which you read in
lesson 30), popular stories collected in the Jataka tales, Hitopadesa etc, and numerons
mythological legends in the Puranas Stories from these were transmitted orally by
professional story tellers, bards and even local temple priests. In the course of telling
stories, many variations occurred over time. So we have today, numerous different
versions of popular legends. Books thus touched the lives of many people even though
very few could read or write.
Each book had to be copied out by hand. Such handwritten copies are called
manuscripts. Manuscript production became, a specialized art in medieval times.
Scribes used beautiful handwriting called calligraphy. The pages were often
decorated with beautiful illustrations. Copying manuscripts was obviously a laborious
process, so very few copies were made.
Printing was introduced in the mid 16th century. Books could now be produced in far
greater numbers in lesser time and lower cost. However since few people were
literate, the immediate effect was limited. A more dramatic transformation took place
in the 19th Century when full use of the press and printing technology was made by
nationalists and social reformers."

HISTORY
 CULTURAL COMMUNICATION
The first newspaper in India was published in 1760 in English by an officer of the
East India Co. This was followed by many others. These newspapers focused on
providing information about Europe to Englishmen in India.
From the early 19 th century, many newspapers began to appear in the vernacular
languages. They were published by nationalists who had the interests of Indians in
mind. News and views were carried across not only to the educated few, but through
them to many others as well. Many thinkers saw that British domination of India
could be overcome only if the traditional ills of Indian society were first removed.
These reformers not only campaigned directly, but also used the press to build public
opinion. One such reformer was Raja Rammohan Roy of Bengal.
In 1821, Rammohan began to publish the newspaper Samachar Kaumudi’ in Bengali,
followed by the Mierat-ul-akhbar’ in Persian in 1822 and the ‘Brahmanical Maga-
zine’ in English. Through these papers, he advocated education of women and widow
remarriage and attacked sati and the ills of the caste system. He also published nu-
merous pamphlets underlining his vision of an ideal society based on the best teach-
ings from major religions of the world. He founded a community called the Brahmo
Samaj which was joined by numerous educated and progressive men in Bengal. It
was owing to the printing press that Rammohan’s ideas could reach such a wide
audience. You can estimate the power of the press when you consider that a rival
newspaper, ‘Chanridka’ was published in 1822 to oppose his ideas of social reform.
We see thus that newspapers and magazines do not merely give information about
events and occurrences around the world, but also mould our ways of thinking. Ideas
and views have of course been exchanged from time immemorial. What however is
specific to modern forms of communication is that the transmission of ideas becomes
a one-way process. While the owner of a newspaper can influence the views of its
readers, the reader cannot exert a similar influence. Can you see the similarity with
globalization about which you read in lesson 29.

31.2 MUSIC AS A VEHICLE OF CULTURE
Among the earliest expression of culture are music and dance. Early people clapped
hands, or beat the earth  with sticks for rhythm to accompany songs and dances.
Gradually many kinds of drums and instruments came to be used. Garba Gujarat,
Kathakali from Kerala and Gidda, Bhangra from Punjab are examples of folk dance.
These were and are still performed to celebrate festive occasions, to mark important
ceremonies, to express various sentiments, and sometimes even to serve as a channel
of protest.
Folk songs celebrate spring, the coming of rains, or the ripening of corn which are all
central to the agricultural cycle. There are also songs of masons and potters. You may
have heard construction workers singing while heaving heavy loads as a team listen
to them carefully the words are about their work.
There are also numerous songs by and about women-expressing the sorrow of a
lover whose beloved has gone away, of a girl leaving her parental home upon her
marriage, even about the conflict between mother and daughter-in-law.
Folk music is by its very nature participatory. It evolves along with the people’s experi-
ences. Folk art can therefore be said to be ‘consumed’ by the same people who create it.
Folk culture is not meant for an audience. However, in modern times, the original
purpose of this culture is transformed. Thus you may sometimes see folk dances
performed on stage while an audience watches!
You read about classical culture in lesson 29. Classical music is a highly developed
form of music since it is based on precise rules, it can be called the grammar of music
singing or playing it (on an instrument) requires a long period of intensive training.
However, anyone can derive great joy from listening to it. In fact, numerous melodies
of film and folk songs are based on classical ragas/or simplified forms of classical
ragas. Both classical and folk music have interacted closely and enriched each other
for centuries, so much so that it is sometimes difficult to draw a sharp dividing line.
Classical music was earlier patronised by kings. The legendary Tansen was one of
the nine jewels in the court of the Mughal emperor, Akbar.
Nowadays business houses, and national and international cultural organizations
patronize classical music.
Related to both these kinds of music is that used for religious purposes. In fact many
folk and classical songs have religious themes.
The earliest example of religious music in India come from the Samaveda. This 3000
year old  text comprises Vedic chants set to melody for recitation during the perfor-
mance of sacrifices.
From medieval times, the compositions of Bhakti and Sufi saints were sung by their
followers and by lay worshippers. These songs are familiar to us today as bhajans and
qawwalis. The lyrics express devotion and love for a personal god sometimes they
request divine help to tide over worldly troubles. Qawwalis and bhajans often have a
classical foundation and a popular or folk form."

A comparatively new form of music is film music. Initially film music relies very
heavily on classical and folk music. Many of the old, popular film songs are based on
melodies form both Indian and western classical music. But film music also evolved
certain now features. It brought into use the orchestra which originally belong to
western classical music in addition to Indian instruments. Nowadays of course, new
kinds of fusion music are evolved everyday.
Bhajans are sometimes related to the experiences of the common people. The
dohas of Kabir for eg., frequently refer to his hereditary profession of weaving.
Qawwalis are specially associated with dargahs, ie. Shrines of venerated Sufi saints.
In Gurudwaras, the Granth Sahib, the sacred text of the Sikhs is recited in a
musical way. The Granth Sahib is a compilation of the sayings of the 10 Sikh gurus
as well as numerous Bhakti and Sufi saints.
The person who recites the Granth Sahib undergoes not only religious training but
also training in classical music, and is therefore called ‘raagi’.
Film songs are dependent not only on one of the theme of the film but also on techno-
logical considerations. The earliest recording mechanisms at the start of our century
could run for only 3½  minutes at a time. So a format evolved where by a song would
last between 3 and 3½ minutes. Now with technological advancement, continuous
recording is possible for hours together, but film songs retain the established format.
Next time you hear a song on the radio, you can time it yourself.
Music like all expression of culture, carries ideas. The Bauls of Bengal have
traditionally carried their messages of universal brotherhood and unselfishness through
their songs.
Devotional songs express not only the emotions of the worshippers but also draw
others into the fold. Today music serves as an important bridge in the global village
about which you read in lesson 29. While assimilating new forms, it is important to
remember not to lose one’s own rich heritage of music.

Contacts between India and the outside world flourished between the 2nd century BC
and the 2nd century AD. Political and commercial interaction led to interchange of
ideas and wide ranging social and cultural development. Buddhism was adaptive to
the new circumstances and won followers among the Indo Greeks, and Central Asians.
Missionary monks traveled with traders and established monasteries in far-flung
areas in central Asia, from there, Buddhism spread further to China.
Interaction with the Greeks led to developments in sculpture. Earlier the Buddha was
represented in the carvings on stupa gateways only symbolically by a wheel, lotus
pipal tree etc. now following the models of Greek gods like Apollo, he was repre-
sented in human form.
Parallel to this was the development of a complex mythology. Popular belief in
rebirth and reincarnation led to belief in many hundreds of previous lives of the
Buddha. These earlier Buddhas birth were called Bodhisattvas. Bodhisattvas were
imagined as compassionate beings entirely concerned with the welfare of fellow
beings. Worshippers could pray to them to ease their troubles and help them with their
worldly cares.
 31.3 CULTURAL FORMS & SPREAD OF BUDDHISM
You have learnt that religion is one of the features of our cultural heritage. Religious
ideas may themselves be transmitted through the medium of culture. Let us consider
the example of Buddhism.
The Buddha lived in the 6th century BC. He preached that the nature of the world is
sorrowful and to free oneself from it, one must overcome desire. He asked his
followers to led simple, virtuous lives and to follow a middle path between extreme
austerity and luxury.
The Buddha’s message was quickly accepted by the common people because he
spoke in the common language, Prakrit. While the Brahmana’s used Sanskrit, a
language which ordinary people didn’t understand.
The Buddhists also adopted and adapted a number of religious and cultural practices.
For example, the worship of trees was a popular practice. The Buddhists suggested
that tree worship was identical with the worship of the bodhi tree at Bodh Gaya.
According to Buddhist traditions, the Buddha had meditated sitting under the tree and
had attained enlightenment here.
Another popular practice was the erection of circular mounds over the remains of the
dead as a kind of memorial. The relatives and associates of the dead offered worship
at such mounds. The Buddha’s followers adopted this practice and erected stupas or"

 CULTURAL COMMUNICATION
mounds which often contained relics of the Buddha such as his teeth or objects he
was supposed to have used.
As Buddhism spread, Buddhists came into contact with the Indo-Greeks who had
settled in the north west of the subcontinent. The Greeks had an old tradition of
representing their gods in human form. The Buddhist adopted this tradition as well,
depicting the Buddha in an identical fashion. (Fig. 31.1)
Fig31.1 Buddha
Here is a little Jataka story known as the Bidala Kukuta Jataka (the Jataka of the
cat and the cock). The story runs as follows:
The cat tells the cock that she wants to marry him. Her plan is to get the cock
down from the tree and eat him. However, the cock is wise and refuses to get
“married”. The Buddhist preachers identified the wise cock with the Buddha in a
previous birth. Look at the lively sculptural representation of the story from Bharhut
(central India).
The Buddhists also adopted hundreds of popular folk stories. In the Buddhist tradition
they were known as Jatakas or birth stories of the Buddha. These were regarded as
stories about the previous births and lives of the Buddha. Many of these stories were
also depicted in sculpture.
 Stories form the Jatakas were also depicted in paintings on the cave walls at Ajanta
as well as on the railing surrounding the Sanchi stupa (MP). Men and women who
visited these places and saw these works of art would be reminded of stories they
knew. At the same time, they would be taught about Buddhism through these stories.
Buddhist teachers were not the only ones to use a variety of cultural means to spread
their message. If we look at any of our major religious traditions, including
Christianity, Hinduism, Islam and Jainism, we will find that they owe their long lived
success to the many ways in which their message has been transmitted-through"

build centres of worship.
Ancient and popular fertility cults centering around worship of mother goddesses
were also incorporated in the growing religious mythology of Buddhism. Each
Bodhisattva was associated with a female divinity called Tara. The Bodhisattvas
were believed to act through these goddesses. This paring of male and female pow-
ers is a characteristic feature of numerous fertility cults. The adoption of such cultural
motifs of folk beliefs and practices made acceptance of Buddhism very easy.
While these developments led to the growing popularity of Buddhism the original
simple teachings of the Buddha were almost forgotten. The Buddha had firmly re-
fused to perform miracles and opposed any attempt to be worshipped. However, he
was now considered a deity, and stories of miracles performed by the Bodhisatvas
became the basis of the faith.
Buddhishm gradually died out in the country of its origin not only because it lost
the original, simple teaching. The monks lost touch with the ordinary people as
patronage from rulers and merchants made the monasteries wealthy. The newer
Buddhist texts were composed in Sanskrit which was not understood by the
common people.
