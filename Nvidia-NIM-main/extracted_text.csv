Olympic Games
 
 
 
 
 
Olympic Games are the most important
international athletic competition in the
world. They are held every four years,
each time in a different country. This"
dgx\gk.pdf,"world’s oldest sports event brings
together thousands of the world’s finest
athletes to compete against one another
in a variety of individual and team
sports. More than 10,000 athletes
representing over 190 nations
participate in the Olympics. Millions of
people attend the games and more than 1
billion people throughout the world
watch the Olympics on television.
 
Ancient Olympics
The Olympics Games originated in
ancient Greece and were held from 776
BC to AD 393. They were celebrated
like religious festivals, honouring Zeus,
the king of the gods. The Roman"
dgx\gk.pdf,"conquered Greece during the 140’s BC,
and the games soon lost their religious
meaning. In AD 393, Emperor
Theodosius I banned the games.
 
Modern Olympics
Baron Pierre de Coubertine, a french
educator, revived the games to
encourage world peace and friendship
and to promote healthy sporting
competition for the youth of the world.
The first modern Olympic Games were
held in Athens, Greece, in 1896. In the
opening ceremony, the athletes of
Greece march into the stadium first, in
honour of the original games held in
ancient Greece. The athletes of the host"
dgx\gk.pdf,"country enter last.
 
The International Olympic Committee
The International Olympic Committee
(IOC) is the governing body of the
Olympic Games. The IOC has its
headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland.
The Committee approves the sports and
events to be included in the games. The
IOC also selects the host cities for the
games, seven years in advance. Host
cities provide a special housing
compound called the Olympic Village
for the athletes and coaches.
 
Olympic Flame
The flame symbolizes the light of spirit,"
dgx\gk.pdf,"knowledge and life, and it is a message
of peace. The fire is ignited in Olympia,
Greece, by using a mirror to concentrate
the rays of the Sun. Runners transport the
flame in a torch relay from Greece to the
site of the games. The final runner
carries the torch into the stadium, circles
the tract and lights a huge 
cauldron
(pot). The flame is kept burning
throughout the games and then
extinguished during the closing
ceremony.
 
Olympic Emblem and Flag
The Olympic Emblem, created in 1913,
consists of five interlocking rings that
represent the continents of Africa, Asia,"
dgx\gk.pdf,"Australia, Europe and the Americas. The
flag of every nation competing in the
games has at least one of these colours.
The Olympic Flag is white in colour,
originally made of cotton. The Emblem
is placed in the middle of the flag.

Olympic Motto
Citius, Altius, Fortius"
dgx\gk.pdf,"These are Latin words which are
translated as:
‘Swifter, Higher, Stronger’.
 
Olympic Epigram
“The essential thing in life is not
conquering but fighting well.”
 
Olympic Medals
The winners are awarded medals, but no
prize money. The top three finishers in
each event receive a medal and a
diploma. The next five finishers get only
a diploma. Each first-place winner
receives a gold medal, which is actually
made of silver and coated with gold."
dgx\gk.pdf,"The second-place medal is made of
silver and the third-place medal is made
of bronze. The design for the medal
changes for each Olympics. All
members of a winning relay team get a
medal. In team sports, all the members
of a winning team who have played in at
least one of the games during the
competition receive a medal.
 
The Summer Games
The Olympic Games consist of the
Summer Games and the Winter Games.
The Summer Games are held during the
summer season of the host city, usually
between July and October. These games
last 16 days. Athletes compete in more"
dgx\gk.pdf,"than 270 separate events during the
Summer Games. Women first
participated in Olympics in 1900 in
Paris.
 
The Winter Games
The Winter Games with over 60 events
are usually held in February and last 16
days. The games attract approximately
2,000 athletes from around 60 countries.
The Winter Games, established in 1924,
took place the same year as the Summer
Games. Beginning in 1994, the Winter
and Summer Games were divided and
scheduled on four-year cycles two years
apart.

Animal Facts
 
 
 
 
 
Flying Fish
The flying fish cannot fly like a bird, but
it leaps into the air, up to 3 m and then
glides for about 200 m before splashing"
dgx\gk.pdf,"back. It usually does this only when
frightened.
 
 
Egg Laying Mammal
Platypus is a mammal, although it lays
eggs. It grows up to 60 cm long, lives in
a burrow and hunts in the water. It is
found in Australia. Only a few mammals
lay eggs."
dgx\gk.pdf," 
 
Bee-size Baby
A new-born kangaroo measures only
about 2 cm. It crawls into its mother’s
pouch and stays there for six months,
feeding on milk and growing.
 
 "
dgx\gk.pdf,"Musical Insects
Insects have no voice. The noise they
make are all produced by their wings or
legs. The rapid movement of their wings
or legs make that noise. Grasshoppers
sing by rubbing their legs against a rough
patch on their wings. Crickets use their
wings to make sound.
 
 
Unique Pattern
No two zebras have exactly the same
pattern of stripes. Like human
fingerprints, each zebra’s stripe pattern"
dgx\gk.pdf,"is unique.
 
 
Vampire’s Dinner
Vampire bats, found in South America,
feed on blood. They lap blood by bitting
asleep animals without disturbing them.
The bat’s saliva contains a substance
which stops the blood from clotting.
 
Longest Pregnancy
The Asian elephant has the longest
pregnancy period in mammals. It has an"
dgx\gk.pdf,"average pregnancy period of one year
nine months and a maximum of two years
one month.
 
 
Great Hunters
Although sharks have poor eyesight, but
they have an excellent sense of smell.
They can smell blood diluted a million
times in water and thus can detect a
wounded animal in the sea. All living
animals produce a small amount of
electricity. Sharks can sense this"
dgx\gk.pdf,"electricity and find where animals are
hiding.
 
 
Smart Cuckoos
Cuckoos do not make their nests. A
female cuckoo lays an egg in the nest of
another bird and takes away one of the
host’s eggs to make room for it. The host
bird has the task of hatching and feeding
the young cuckoo. As it grows up, the
young cuckoo pushes all the host bird’s
eggs and young from the nest. By the
time it is ready to leave the nest, the"
dgx\gk.pdf,"young cuckoo may be several times the
size of its long-suffering foster parents.
 
Electric Eel
An electric eel is a freshwater fish
measuring up to 2 m long. It produces
powerful electric shocks of up to 500

Champion Migrant
The Arctic tern is the champion in"
dgx\gk.pdf,"migration. It travels the longest distance
during the migratory journey. It covers a
round trip of about 36,000 km from the
Arctic to the Antarctic and back.
 
 
Wandering Wonder
The wandering albatross has the longest
wings of any bird. When outstretched,
they measure as much as 3.3 m from tip

Red Alert
Most of the people think that a bull is
irritated by the red colour. Well, it is not
the colour that irritates the animal. A
bull is colour-blind! It gets angry to see
the cloth or bull fighter’s cape because it
is being waved about.
 
Sense of Smell
Unlike most birds, the kiwi has a good
sense of smell which helps it to find"
dgx\gk.pdf,"food at night. A kiwi has nostrils at the
tip of its long beak. It uses its sense of
smell to find out earthworms and insects
hiding in the soil.
 
Rarest Pandas
Giant pandas are some of the rarest
animals in the world. There are less than
1,000 giant pandas left. They live only in
high mountain ranges in three isolated
parts of China. They need to eat about 20
kg of one special type of bamboo a day
and spend about twelve hours a day
feeding. Many pandas starve if the
bamboo crop fails or is cut down."

Whales are Mammals
Whales are not fish. They are mammals,
as they give birth to babies and feed
them on milk. They do not have gills like
fish and therefore come to the surface
every 5-10 minutes to breathe. They
breathe through blowholes on their
backs."

They are not Insects
Spiders and scorpions are not insects.
An insect has six legs whereas a spider
or a scorpion has eight legs. They belong
to a family of animals called 
Arachnida.
 
 
Do they really Dance"
dgx\gk.pdf,"It is a myth that snakes dance on the
music played by a snake-charmer for
them. In fact, they are deaf! They just

National Parks and
Sanctuaries
 
 
 
 
 
A national park or a sanctuary is a
protected area for the animals. Poaching"
dgx\gk.pdf,"and killing of wildlife is illegal under
the Wildlife Protection Act. Cultivation,
grazing domestic animals and collection
of forest products are permitted in a
sanctuary, but such activities are strictly
prohibited in a national park. At present,
India has 89 national parks and 490
sanctuaries covering about 4.7% of the
total geographical area of the country.

Seven Wonders of the
Ancient World
 
 
 
 
 
The Seven Wonders of the ancient world
were seven outstanding objects that"
dgx\gk.pdf,"were built in ancient times. Today, only
the pyramids are still standing. All the
rest have been destroyed by earthquakes,
fire or invaders. These Seven Wonders
are arranged here in the order in which
they were built.
 
The Pyramids of Egypt
(Giza, Egypt; built from 2700 to 2500
BC)
They were built as royal tombs for the
Egyptian pharoahs. There are many
ancient pyramids in Egypt, but the
greatest are the three at Giza. The largest
of these is the Great Pyramid of Cheops
which stands about 146 m high.
 "
dgx\gk.pdf," 
 
The Hanging Gardens of Babylon
(Iraq; built around 580 BC)
These were spectacular gardens, rising
in a series of terraces (rather than
hanging). They were built by king
Nebuchadnezzar II for his wife. Nothing
remains of them.
 "
dgx\gk.pdf," 
 
The Statue of Zeus at Olympia
(Greece; made around 457 BC)
It was a wooden statue of the king of the
gods, Zeus, covered with gold and ivory.
This 12 m high majestic seated figure
was created by the sculptor Phidias.
 "
dgx\gk.pdf," 
 
The Temple of Artemis (or Diana) at
Ephesus
(Turkey; built around 400 BC)
It was one of the largest temples in the
ancient world built mostly of marble in
honour of a Greek goddess, Artemis.
Some of its marble columns are in the
British Museum in London.
 "
dgx\gk.pdf," 
 
The Tomb of Mausolus
(Turkey; built around 353 BC)
This was a magnificent tomb of
Mausolus, a ruler of Caria, built at
Helicarnassus by his widow. It was a
very massive tomb of white marble.
 "
dgx\gk.pdf," 
 
The Colossus of Rhodes
(Greece; built around 280 BC)
It was a huge, bronze statue of Sun god
Helios, stood at the entrance of the
harbour of Rhodes. It was about 30 m
high.
 "
dgx\gk.pdf," 
 
The Pharos of Alexanderia
(Egypt; built around 270 BC)
This was the largest lighthouse of the
ancient world, built on the island of
Pharos in the harbour of Alexandria by
Ptolemy II. It was about 135 m tall. It
had a wood fire burning on top and its
light could be seen 65 km away.

much of the UN’s work and debates
major issues of international affairs.
2. The Security Council has the major
responsibility in the UN to maintain
international peace and security. The

to carry out this responsibility.
3. The Secretariat manages the day-to-
day business of the United Nations. Its
main job is to provide services for all
the other UN organs.
4. The Economic and Social Council
works to encourage higher standards of
living, better health, cultural and
educational cooperation among nations
and observance of human rights."
dgx\gk.pdf,"5. The International Council of Justice
handles international legal disputes. The
headquarters of the court are at The

Nobel Prize
 
 
 
 
 
Nobel Prize, named after Alfred
Bernhard Nobel, is the most prestigious
award in the world. The six Nobel
Prizes are awarded each year to those"
dgx\gk.pdf,"who, in the opinion of judges, have
contributed the most in the fields of
physics, chemistry, physiology or
medicine, literature, peace and
economics. The first prizes were
awarded in 1901. The Nobel Prize for
economics was established by the
Swedish National Bank and awarded for
the first time in 1969.
The Nobel Prizes are awarded
annually on December 10, the death
anniversary of the founder. He left 9
million US dollars to set up the prizes.
The interest that this money earns each
year is used for the prizes. The value of
each of the six prizes is about 1 million
US dollars. Besides the cash prize, each"
dgx\gk.pdf,"award consists of a gold medal and a
diploma bearing a citation. The peace
prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway. The
other prizes are presented in Stockholm,
Sweden.
A candidate may not apply directly for
a prize. A qualified person must submit
each name in writing. Two or three
people may share a prize. Sometimes,
prizes are not awarded or awarded in a
latter year. The peace prize has been
omitted most frequently. For the literary
prize, the Swedish Academy considers
only works that have appeared in print.
The academy usually selects an author
for his or her complete work rather than
for one book."

Alfred Bernhard Nobel (1833–1896)
Alfred Bernhard Nobel was a Swedish
inventor and industrialist. He was born
in Stockholm in 1833. He invented how
to make a safe and manageable
explosive, called dynamite, in 1866.
Construction and mining companies"
dgx\gk.pdf,"and the military ordered large
quantities of dynamite because of its
relative safety and explosive power.
Nobel set up factories around the
world, and sales of dynamite and other
explosives brought him great wealth.
Within a few years, Nobel became one
of the world’s richest men.
 
 
 
Nobel was found dead on December
10, 1896 at his desk. Swedes found out"
dgx\gk.pdf,"about the Nobel Prizes after his death,
when they read his will in which he had
donated the annual income from his
fortune to support the award. In his
will, he ordered that, “The most worthy
shall receive the prize, whether he is
Swedish or not.”

Invention
 — the act of creating or
designing something which did not exist
before e.g. Graham Bell invented
telephone.
Discovery
 — the act of finding out or
bringing to light or gaining knowledge of
something, especially for the first time
which already existed e.g. Columbus
discovered America.
